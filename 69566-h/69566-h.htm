  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When, in the year 1892, Sir Peter Le Page Renouf began the publication of his translation
of the Book of the Dead, his intention was that the work, once completed, should be preceded
by an elaborate Introduction, giving, besides all the information concerning the form and the
history of the book, his views as to its sense and its religious value.</p>

<p class='c000'>As with the unfinished part of the translation,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> so here, we are left without any notes or any
clue whatever as to the form which this introduction was to have taken, and we are obliged
to resort to the fifth of the Hibbert lectures, given by Renouf in 1879, in order to know his
views about the book.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Before speaking of its contents, we have to state briefly under what form the book has come
down to us. It is hardly necessary to repeat that it is no book at all in the ordinary sense
of the word. It is neither a unity nor a whole, it is a collection which has grown by degrees,
at various epochs. Undoubtedly part of it goes back as far as the Old Empire; the texts of
the Middle Empire show already that there were various editions, and we are forced to
admit that its origin is not much later than the beginning of Egyptian civilization, as we
see that some of the rubrics attribute certain chapters to a king of the 1st dynasty. In
the course of centuries the original text was modified and enlarged, new chapters were added,
revisions were made, without casting these detached fragments into a whole. The various
parts of the book were always independent, like the Hebrew Psalms; the acceptance of a
chapter does not necessarily imply the acceptance of the next chapter, and it seems as if the
relatives of the deceased chose in the collection which was at their disposal what they liked
best, and the number of chapters which corresponded to the price they wished to pay for a
papyrus.</p>

<p class='c000'>This description applies chiefly to the texts of the Book of the Dead of the period prior
to the XXVIth dynasty. Under the Saïte kings it seems that a complete revision of the text
was made; a definite order was adopted, which was not rigidly binding on the writers, but to
which they generally adhered; various chapters were added, especially the last ones, 162-165,
which are never found in the older copies. It seems also that something like what we should
call an authorized version was adopted; and this was done by men to whom the book was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>hardly intelligible. A great many glosses were introduced, which were copied afterwards in
all the hieroglyphic and hieratic texts. Although we do not find the strict accuracy of Hebrew
manuscripts, the number of variants in the Saïte, Ptolemaïc or Roman texts is considerably
smaller than in the manuscripts of the Theban period, and a collation of the hundreds of
papyri of late epoch which fill our museums would lead to no great result.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, it is from a text generally considered as Saïtic, but which I believe to be of
the Ptolemaïc epoch, that the Book of the Dead has been first made known in all its extent.
In 1842 Lepsius published the long papyrus in the Turin Museum, a document which he
called “the largest piece of Egyptian literature which has been preserved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before him Champollion had seen it, and had noticed that a great number of repetitions
of the same text existed in various museums. He made use of it in his grammar, quoted
here and there a sentence taken from it, but he did not make a special study of the document.
Lepsius understood at once the importance of the book, which was the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vade-mecum</i></span> of the
deceased, and seeing how much more extensive the Turin Papyrus was than the short copies
which had been published before, he traced the whole document and published it two years
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lepsius gave to this work the name of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>, “Book of the Dead,” in opposition to
the name of “Ritual” adopted by Champollion, which is certainly incorrect. It is no Ritual; a
few chapters with a ritualistic character have been introduced into it; for instance, the chapter
connected with the ceremony of “opening the mouth of the deceased,” which is occasionally
met with, or Chapter 171, “chapter of wrapping up (the deceased) in a pure garment;” but
these are rare exceptions. On the whole the Book of the Dead differs widely from a Ritual.
It is not the priest who speaks, there are no minute prescriptions as to how a ceremony is to
be performed; all the prayers and hymns are put in the deceased’s mouth, it is he whose
speech is supposed to be heard in the other world.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>, Book of the Dead, is not a translation of the Egyptian title, which is:
book of <img class="hiero" src="images/h082.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h083.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h084.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>pert m hru</i>. As Renouf says, “Three simple words, perfectly
unambiguous when taken singly, but by no means easy of explanation when taken together
without a context;” and in fact at the present day no final translation has been given of these
three words. Renouf translates, “coming forth by day,” as will be seen in the numerous
examples which occur in this volume; but several objections may be raised against this
interpretation, to which we should prefer, “coming out of the day,” the day being the period
of a man’s life, having its morning and its evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>The book is divided into fragments called <img class="hiero" src="images/h055.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, to each of which Lepsius has given a
number, following the order of the great Turin Papyrus, and which he calls chapters. Although
his numbering is not quite correct, it has been adhered to in all the subsequent editions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his lecture<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> on the Book of the Dead, Renouf insists on the difficulty of translating it:
“Nothing can exceed the simplicity and the brevity of the sentences; and yet the difficulties
which a translator has to overcome are very great. In the first place, the text is extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>corrupt. The unsatisfactory condition of the text is owing to different causes. The reasons
which writers on Hebrew, Greek or Latin palæography have enumerated for the purpose of
accounting for mistakes in manuscripts, apply with much greater force to the funereal manuscripts
of the Egyptians; for as these were not intended to be seen by any mortal eye, but to
remain for ever undisturbed in the tomb, the unconscientious scribe had no such check upon
his carelessness as if his work were liable to be subjected to the constant inspection of the
living. But the most conscientious scribe might easily commit numerous errors. Many of
them are to be traced to a confusion between signs which resemble each other in the cursive,
or as it is called, the hieratic character, but not in hieroglyphic writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Besides the errors of copyists, there are different readings, the origin of which is to be
traced to the period during which the chapters were handed down by word of mouth only.
There are copies which bear evidence that a critical choice has been made between the
different readings of a passage, but the common practice was to admit the inconsistent readings
into the text itself....</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some of the variants have unquestionably arisen from the difficulty of understanding
the ancient texts. I have no doubt whatever that some of the chapters of the Book of the
Dead were as obscure to Egyptians living under the eleventh dynasty as they are to ourselves....
The most accurate knowledge of the Egyptian vocabulary and grammar will
however not suffice to pierce the obscurity arising from what M. de Rougé called symbols
or allegories, which are in fact simple mythological allusions. The difficulty is not in literally
translating the text, but in understanding the meaning which lies concealed beneath familiar
words.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These words of Renouf have still a very great force, although in the last twenty years
some progress has been made towards a better understanding of the text. When Renouf gave
the above description of the difficulties of the translation, the main source from which he
could derive his information was what he called “the corrupt Turin text.” Since then a
critical edition has been made.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It is based on texts of the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties,
written at a time when the intelligence of the book was not lost to the same extent as under
the Saïtes or the Ptolemies, as may be ascertained from the considerable number of glosses
introduced into the Turin text which are absent from the older versions. This edition has
been compiled from various papyri, as the older ones are much shorter than the later ones;
it is not a single document like Lepsius’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>; most of the chapters have been found
in their old form; a few are missing, but a good number have been added to the list which
have fallen out of the late versions. Generally it is from this critical text that Renouf made
his translation. Occasionally he may choose an older version from a tomb, or perhaps a
papyrus of the British Museum, but he hardly ever reverts to the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span> unless he
has no other resource at his disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless the difficulties which Renouf enumerates are only partly removed. We are
still very far from being able to give a final translation of the Book of the Dead, and I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>no doubt that Renouf would repeat about his own work what he says of Dr. Birch’s translation,
“Many parts of it, where most faithful to the original, must in consequence of that very
fidelity be utterly unintelligible to an English reader.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No doubt Renouf’s translation is a great step towards making the book more intelligible;
still the reader may often stumble over sentences out of which it is hardly possible to make
a reasonable sense, in spite of their grammatical correctness, and which at first sight will seem
childish, not to say, with Renouf, “outrageous nonsense.” But we may say with certainty
that they were not so to the old Egyptians. Under this extraordinary or even ridiculous
garment may be hidden some very simple, or even elementary truths. Let us remember that
we have not yet unravelled all the intricacies of the Egyptian mythology, which plays such an
important part in the book. Moreover, we only begin now to understand how the Egyptians
expressed abstract ideas. When we speak of passion, shame, remorse, hope, we have so
thoroughly lost sight of the concrete element in these words, that we are apt to forget that
originally they must have been metaphors, and that they must have expressed something
striking the senses, and connected with the material world. An instance will illustrate the
difficulty in this translation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter 112 relates how, owing to an imprudent request, Horus was the victim of
Sutu, who inflicted a wound on his eye, which caused him great suffering, and the text adds:
<img class="hiero" src="images/h085.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h086.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h087.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h088.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h089.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h090.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h072.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <em>lo! he ate his heart</em>. Renouf translates, “and wrath devoured
his heart.” I should prefer, “he regretted sorely (his foolish request).” I believe to eat one’s
heart to mean, “to feel regret, repentance, or remorse.” There the abstract meaning is not
difficult to find out; but in other cases, as long as we have not discovered the key to the
metaphor, we may go far astray, or if we do not go beyond the literal explanation, we miss
the abstract sense, which is the true one.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, because the work will not bear the character of finality, because some obscurities
will not be removed, and some difficulties remain unsolved, there is no reason why a scholar
like Renouf should have shrunk from attempting the translation of the Book of the Dead, a
work which he had before his eyes for years, and which he considered as the crown of his
Egyptological labours.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lecture quoted above gives us Renouf’s ideas as to the purpose and the sense of
the book: it is the beatification of the dead considered in three aspects:</p>

<p class='c000'>The renewed existence “as upon earth.” The deceased enjoys an existence similar to that
which he has led upon earth; he has the use of his limbs, he eats and drinks and satisfies
every one of his physical wants exactly as in his former life. The gods themselves minister
to him occasionally, and contribute to his welfare and to his pleasures. The bliss of the
future state consists chiefly in the pleasures of agricultural life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Transformation. The deceased has the range of the entire universe in every shape and
form he desires. He can assume any appearance he likes. But these transformations are
not forced upon him; he has no definite series to go through; they depend simply on his
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>Identification with Osiris and other gods. The identification with Osiris, which is already
mentioned in the earliest parts of the book, is taken for granted later on, since the name of
the deceased is always preceded by “Osiris.” He may be assimilated to other gods; for
instance, in the 42nd chapter every limb is assimilated to a different deity. This Osirian
nature gives the deceased the power to triumph over the numerous enemies whom he has to
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these three benefits which the book confers on the deceased we should add a fourth:
viz., complete preservation from dismemberment and decay. There is evidently in some of the
prayers a remembrance of a time when the deceased were dismembered at their burial; and
this way of treating the corpse is for the deceased an object of horror. The frequent mention
of reconstituting the body, the promises that no part of it shall be taken away, all this shows
of what supreme importance it was for him that his body should remain intact. Without a
well preserved body there could be no life in the other world; its destruction implies the
destruction of the whole individual. This belief is the origin of mummification, for decay is
the strongest agent of dismemberment and the certain ruin of the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the outlines of the principal tenets of the Book of the Dead. If we inquire
where they originated, there is no doubt that the bulk of the book came from Heliopolis. It
is the doctrine of that ancient city and of its priests. Some of the chapters may be attributed
to the priests at Abydos, as M. Maspero suggests; but it seems certain that, except for a
small part, the birthplace of the Book of the Dead is the city of Ra Tmu, the place connected
with the oldest religious traditions of the country, and which may rightly be called the religious
capital of Egypt.</p>

These are two very difficult
words, and very different meanings have been assigned to them.
But when the entire evidence is examined the result is plain enough.
Each of the words has for determinative the sign, <img class="hiero" src="images/h013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, expressive
of some kind of utterance. It is a λόγος of some kind
has for its first letter the causative <img class="hiero" src="images/h017.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The question therefore
is, what are the meanings of the simpler forms <img class="hiero" src="images/h018.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h012.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <i>tes</i>, and

<p class='c000'>The most common, indeed the only true, meaning of <img class="hiero" src="images/h018.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h012.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is
‘rising,’ and even ‘raising.’ This is too well-known to require
proof. <img class="hiero" src="images/h011.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h012.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is ‘causing to rise.’ The Pyramid text of Teta says
(l. 270), “Horus hath given his children that they may raise thee up
<img class="hiero" src="images/h012.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h018.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h023.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.” In the same religious text, l. 248, <img class="hiero" src="images/h018.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h012.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />

M. Déveria has produced excellent evidence showing that
<img class="hiero" src="images/h062.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <em>maāt-ḫeru</em> has the sense of ‘victorious, triumphant.’ But the
sense of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>véridique</i></span> is untenable. <img class="hiero" src="images/h063.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ḫeru</i> is ‘voice’ not
‘speech.’ In <cite>Proceedings S.B.A.</cite>, Vol. VI, p. 192, note, I have
quoted a passage from a chapter (now numbered 181 in M. Naville’s

Law.” It is essentially a <em>divine</em> title (see “Altar at Turin,” <cite>Transactions</cite>,
III, pl. II, <i>line</i> 10, appended to Mr. Bonomi’s article), and
in <em>no</em> Egyptian text is it used of mortals supposed to be living.

One of the designations of Osiris. Perhaps the word <i>Ba</i>
should be translated Ram, for in the Mendesian Nome Osiris was
worshipped under this form, and was called <img class="hiero" src="images/h044.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h110.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ḣeru šefit</i>,
‘god of the strong face.’ The fact is that whether applied to the
<em>soul</em> or to a <em>ram</em>, the word <i>ba</i> is expressive of ‘power, force.’ The
same word under the form <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h105.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h112.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is used in Chapter 120,
2 (= 12, 2) in the sense of ‘splitting up.’ And this is clearly the
Egyptian concept of the soul--‘the internal force, that which works
within us,’ τὸ ἐνεργοῦν.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word is ideographically written <img class="hiero" src="images/h113.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h105.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> both the
Ram and the cranelike bird being called <i>ba</i>. Some have cleverly
inferred that the Egyptians thought that the soul was of a birdlike
form, and others have not hesitated to consider <i>ba</i> as expressive of
the cry of the <em>ram</em>. The odd thing is that only the ram has this
name, not the <em>sheep</em> or the <em>lamb</em>, who nevertheless indulge in the
same cry. The truth is that in spite of appearances the word <i>ba</i> is
not onomatopoeic here. Whether applied to the ram or to the heron,
the word is expressive of human action and signifies ‘digging
through, cleaving, piercing, splitting.’ The hieroglyphic variants are
very expressive: <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h105.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h114.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h105.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h112.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h105.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h116.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,

in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Denkm.</cite></span> II, 51).</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ram is called in Egyptian <i>ba</i> on account of the digs which
he makes with his head, and a force which has occasioned the name
of ‘ram’ to be given to powerful engines.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The Heron is also called <i>ba</i> because with its bill it <em>cleaves</em> the
fishes which it attacks.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the word which <em>we</em> translate Soul or Spirit is called <em>ba</em>,
because it is conceived as something which ‘pierces, penetrates and
divides.’</p>

<p class='c000'>It is right to point out (to those who may wonder at this
Egyptian etymology) that the Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scio</i></span> ‘I know’ is etymologically
akin to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>seco</i></span> ‘cut,’ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>securis</i></span> ‘an axe,’ and the Greek κείω, κεάζω ‘split,

priests in the service of Ptah. The latter, who held perhaps the
highest sacerdotal office in Egypt, as high priest of Ptah at Memphis,
is repeatedly found combining with his own special office that of the
<i>sem</i>. The ceremony which is here referred to consisted in a grand
procession round the walls of the great sanctuary of Ptah, conveying
upon a sledge the bark <img class="hiero" src="images/h120.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> in which the coffin of the god was supposed
to rest. Sokaru signifies ‘the coffined,’ and Ptah Sokaru is
only a form of Osiris. Abundant details of the ceremony will be found
in the plates of M. Mariette’s <cite>Abydos</cite>, I, pl. 36 and following. The
king Seti I is represented as a Sem priest presiding at the festival.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note1.23'/><a href='#nref1.23'>23.</a>
Or ‘rid of his business.’ The word <img class="hiero" src="images/h125.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>sep</i>, ‘turn,’ has
the different significations of the Latin ‘vices.’</p>

<p class='c000'>In the later recensions this chapter is lengthened out by other
petitions. The deceased asks, among other things, to appear
“before thee, O Lord of the gods, to attain the region of <i>Maāt</i>,
may I rise up a living god, let me shine like the divine host which
is in heaven, let me be as one of you. Let my steps be lifted up in
Cher-ābaut. Let me see the ship<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> of the holy Sahu [Orion],
traversing the sky; let me not be prevented from seeing the lords
of the Tuat [the Netherworld], smelling the fragrance of the sacrificial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>offerings made to the divine host, and sitting with them. Let the
Cher-heb [the priestly ministrant] make invocation over my coffin.
Let me hear the prayers of propitiation. Let the divine ship
Neshemet advance for me, let not my soul and its possessor suffer
repulse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An invocation to Osiris follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hail to thee, Prince of Amenta, Osiris, lord of Nifura; grant
that I may advance in peace towards Amenta, and that the Lords of
Tasert may receive me and say to me, ‘Salutation! Salutation! in
Peace!’ let them make for me a seat by the Prince of the divine
Powers, let the two Chenemta goddesses [Isis and Nephthys] receive
me, in presence of Unneferu, the Victorious. Let me be a follower
of Horus in Re-stau, and of Osiris in Tattu. Let me assume all
forms for the satisfaction of my heart in every place that my Genius
[<i>Ka</i>] wisheth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The following rubric is found as early as the XIXth dynasty in
connection with this chapter, but it seems to have originally been
attached to Chapter 72.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If this discourse is learnt upon earth, or is written upon the
coffin, he (the deceased) may come forth upon every day that he
pleaseth and again enter his house without impediment. And there
shall be given to him bread and beer and flesh meat upon the table
of Râ: he shall receive allotment in the Fields of Aarru [the
Elysian fields of Egyptian mythology], and there shall be given to
him there wheat and barley, for he shall be flourishing as when he
was upon earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Chapter 1 is followed in M. Naville’s edition by another, which
the learned editor calls 1 B. This chapter is found in so very few
copies that the text cannot as yet be restored. The two texts
published by M. Naville differ widely from each other. It was known
however down to the Roman period, though not inserted into copies
of the Book of the Dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is called <cite>Chapter of introducing the Mummy into the Tuat on
the day of burial</cite>. The 124th chapter bears a similar title. The
word here translated mummy is probably not to be understood of
the visible mummy, but of the living personality which it enclosed.
The chapter opens with an invocation, “Hail to thee, who art in
the sacred region of Amenta, the Osiris, [the deceased] knows thee
and thy name, defend him from those Worms which are in Restau,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>who live upon the flesh of men and swallow their blood.” The
names of the Worms were given, but in consequence of the gaps
in the text they cannot now be recovered. The chapter finished
with prayers in which the deceased identifies himself with Horus,
who has taken possession of the throne which his father has given
him; he has taken possession of heaven, and inherited the earth,
and neither heaven nor earth shall be taken from him, for he is Râ,
the eldest of the gods. His mother suckles him and offers him her
breast, which is on the horizon at Dawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>This chapter is found in several of the best MSS., but the text is
extremely corrupt, and must have become absolutely unintelligible.
The Turin text differs greatly from that of the older copies, and the

is the name of the Ape who is seen in the vignettes of the papyri
saluting the rising of the sun. See M. Naville’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>, I,
plates 21 and 22; the Papyrus of Ani, plate 2; the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span> of
Lepsius, Chapters 16 and 126.</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not know how far it is correct to illustrate this undoubted
origin of the Egyptian name for the Ape, as ‘the saluting one,’ by
the following extract of a letter to Cuvier from M. Duvaucelle, about
the Siamang apes in the neighbourhood of Bencoolen in Sumatra.
“They assemble in numerous troops ... and thus united, they
salute the rising and the setting sun with the most terrific cries,
which may be heard at the distance of many miles; and which, when
near, stun, when they do not frighten. This is the morning call of
the mountain Malays, but to the inhabitants of the town, who are
unaccustomed to it, it is a most insupportable annoyance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In this place of the Book of the Dead the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h162.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is a mere
determinative of the sound <i>aān</i> with the notion of <em>salutation</em>, just as
the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h164.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is a determinative of the sound <i>ȧb</i> with the notion
of <em>thirst</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The ‘saluters’ of the rising sun are neither real apes nor men
but the “Spirits of the East” who, as we are told in an inscription of
the tomb of Rameses VI, “effect the rising of Râ by opening the door
at each of the four portals of the eastern horizon of heaven. They
it is who light him on both sides, and go forth in advance of him....
And when he arises they turn into six cynocephali.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

being itself a proof that the difficulty of the text was already felt by
some Egyptian scribe.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the scribe had consulted the oldest texts accessible in his
day, he would probably have seen another way out. Our oldest MS.,
that of Nebseni, reads, <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h172.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h173.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h099.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h174.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h167.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h162.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
<i>bes-kuȧ ȧbu ȧāā(n)u</i>, which signify literally, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“antecedunt me corda
salutantium.”</span> The word <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h172.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>bes</i> is a very common one in
pictures representing the introduction of a king or a god into a
temple. It is the technical term used in the Tablet of Canopus for
the inducting, by the king, of priests into their offices. The subject
of this verb is <img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <em>hearts</em>; an independent word, instead of being
the mere determinative of <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h176.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h090.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The object of the verb is the

And it is easy to see how the later text, which is already found in
<i>Ax</i>, has been corrupted out of the older.</p>

<p class='c000'>On comparing this chapter with the 99th, it would appear that
the occasion for reciting it is on the journey of the heavenly boat

This is one of the most difficult passages in the Book of the
Dead, but I do not see how it can be grammatically understood
otherwise. It is understood from the passage from Light to Darkness
and the converse.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘In his lot,’ literally ‘in him.’</p>

is much too abstract a word for these ancient texts. <img class="hiero" src="images/h277.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" /> implies
‘motion, activity,’ and <img class="hiero" src="images/h194.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is not a simple negation, but implies
‘completion, end’ (τελέω, τέλος), though not ‘cessation.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Our <em>modern</em> acceptation of the word ‘perfect’ is often wrongly
applied to <img class="hiero" src="images/h194.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. We should think rather of such phrases as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘annum

<p class='c000'>This chapter, in the MSS. of which the Turin copy is the type,
is repeated as Chapter 121, with the following rubric:--</p>

<p class='c000'>“Said over an ear-ring of the flower Ânch-amu, put upon the

The Bennu is a bird of the Heron kind. He is very commonly
but, I think, erroneously identified with the Phoenix. The
bird described by Herodotus, II, 73, was in outline and size “very
like an eagle,” which no one could say of the Bennu. He appeared
only once in five hundred years, whereas the Bennu appeared every
day. The fable as told by the Greeks is utterly unsupported by any
Egyptian authority known to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a very great difference between the earlier and the later
texts of this chapter. Former translators, having chiefly the Turin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>text before them, have understood the title of the chapter as intended
“to remove the impurities from the heart of the deceased
person.” The Turin text of the chapter is really unintelligible, and
even in the earlier texts certain passages are so corrupt as to defy
translation.</p>

The word <img class="hiero" src="images/h204.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> was a puzzle to the oldest transcribers. It

‘the god is joined with Law,’ which is supported by some
of the older papyri, is intelligible in itself, but not in this context.

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The fifteenth chapter as it stands in the later recension (represented
by the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>) is of very recent origin. It is in
fact a collection of texts originally independent of each other;
(1) a hymn to Râ at his rising, (2) a litany, (3) a hymn to Râ at his
setting, (4) a hymn to Tmu at his setting, followed by a statement
respecting the spiritual importance of the document.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the last hymn there are no copies of ancient date, but the
other three compositions are found more or less perfect as far back
as the XIXth dynasty. The discrepancies, however, between
the ancient texts furnish so much evidence of free composition on
the part of the scribes, that it is impossible to suppose that they
had before them documents recognised as sacred and canonical.
M. Naville has found it necessary to publish four different forms of
the hymn to the rising, and three of the hymn to the setting sun.
The ideas and expressions throughout these hymns are current in
the religious texts of the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the translation here given I have followed the <em>form</em> adopted
by the later recension, correcting the text when necessary by the
copies written in the better periods.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note15.1'/><a href='#nref15.1'>1.</a>
The text of the Papyrus of Ani has been taken as the basis
of the translation of <span class='sc'>Hymn I</span>. It is the only ancient text which
gives the hymn in the form subsequently acknowledged as canonical.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note15.2'/><a href='#nref15.2'>2.</a>
The sun was represented from the earliest period, as we may
see in the pyramid texts, as performing his celestial journey in a boat,
which during the morning was called the <i>Māāṭit</i> <img class="hiero" src="images/h045.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h209.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h210.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
and in the evening the <i>Sektit</i> <img class="hiero" src="images/h211.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h210.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note15.3'/><a href='#nref15.3'>3.</a>
The stars which <i>set</i> were called the <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h215.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h212.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h100.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h216.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h099.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h213.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
<i>ȧḫmiu ureṭu</i>. The stars which never set, but are always
above the horizon were called <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h215.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h212.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h214.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h213.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ȧḫmiu seku</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The word <i>ȧḫmiu</i> has often been taken for a mere negative, but
it occurs by itself with the sign of <em>stars</em> as a determinative
<img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h020.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h217.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h215.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h219.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. And the whole term is written
<img class="hiero" src="images/h020.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h220.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h221.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h173.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Denkm.</cite></span> III. 271<i>d</i> <em>twice</em>).</p>

<p class='c000'>As one of the meanings of <img class="hiero" src="images/h222.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ḫem</i> is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>minuere</i></span>, and as the
ordinary meaning of the Demotic <img class="hiero" src="images/h223.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h224.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h225.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" /> is “small,” like the Coptic
ϣⲟⲙ = λεπτὸς, it is not improbable that the stars received this
appellation on account of their tiny size as compared with the Sun
and Moon. They were what Horace called the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ignes <i>minores</i>.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun and Moon, as we all know, are called in Gen. i, 16,
the “Two Great Lights.”</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note15.4'/><a href='#nref15.4'>4.</a>
Both the Eastern and the Western horizon are mentioned in
this chapter, but “Horus of the Two Horizons,” has no reference to
this distinction. Whatever the Sun passes through or over is always
conceived as double. The <em>Two Earths</em> imply simply the Earth as
divided by the passage of the Sun above it. It is to M. Grébaut
that we are indebted for the discovery of this important key to many
Egyptian expressions.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note15.5'/><a href='#nref15.5'>5.</a>
<img class="hiero" src="images/h226.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ḫeper</i>, like the German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Werden</i></span>, has primarily the sense
of <em>turning</em>, hence of <em>becoming</em>. It never has the sense of <em>creating</em>.
<img class="hiero" src="images/h226.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h227.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ḫeper t’esef</i> is the equivalent of the Greek αὐτογενής,
like that word is sometimes used for spontaneous productions of the
mineral kingdom, as salt or natron as contrasted with artificial products
of the same nature. It cannot be used for plants, as they have
an origin in something external to themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note15.6'/><a href='#nref15.6'>6.</a>
<em>The Land of the Gods</em> and <em>Punit</em> are the countries lying east
of Egypt. When it is said that gods ‘come from Punit,’ it is not
meant by this that they are of Arabian origin, but simply that Sun,
Moon, and Stars, and Daylight rise in the East. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ex oriente Lux.”</span></p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note15.7'/><a href='#nref15.7'>7.</a>
In many places the divine name Nut has for determinative
the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h228.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" />. Is this an oversight on the part of the scribe, or is
it one more proof that the Egyptians certainly believed in a sky
below the horizon? If so, I have never seen it misplaced.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><a id='note15.8'/><a href='#nref15.8'>8.</a>
The Ant and the Abṭu are sometimes represented by the side
of the solar bark. From the egg of the Abṭu there rises the great
Cat, the Sun. It is, as M. Loret has proved, the <em>Tortoise</em> of the Nile.
As <img class="hiero" src="images/h229.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h084.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ȧbṭu</i>, ‘the <em>month</em>,’ is phonetically homonymous with
<img class="hiero" src="images/h230.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h216.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h231.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ȧbṭu</i>, the Tortoise, and that the latter is
characterised by <img class="hiero" src="images/h232.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h233.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, ‘its rotation, revolving or turning,’
the word <i>ȧbṭu</i>, whether applied to ‘month’ or ‘tortoise’ clearly
signifies ‘the revolving one.’ Our modern words Tortoise, Tortue,
Tortuga, rather express the turning or twisting of the creature’s feet.
In some texts, <i>e.g.</i>, the inscriptions of Amenhotep, the son of Hapu,
Mariette, <em>Karnak</em>, pl. 36, line 22, and at the beginning of the Ani
Papyrus, the word is written <img class="hiero" src="images/h234.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h235.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>abtu</i>. In the later part
of the Ani Papyrus it is written with the initial <img class="hiero" src="images/h230.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note15.9'/><a href='#nref15.9'>9.</a>

of Ani. This interesting variant is of extreme value. It not only
explains a word, the very existence of which has been called in
question, but tells us the Egyptian name for that seat of Horus  at
the prow of the Solar Bark about which I wrote a note in <cite>Proc. Soc.
Bib. Arch.</cite> of Nov. 3, 1891. See the plates attached to the note,

The Litany here translated is that of the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>.

Nechtuamon at Berlin (<i>Ba</i>), a manuscript of the XIXth dynasty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another Litany, preceding <span class='sc'>Hymn I</span>, is found in the Papyrus of

<p class='c000'>And, like the Greek κύκλος, the word comes to signify a circle of

<p class='c000'>But <img class="hiero" src="images/h076.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> also expresses the number nine. Whence in this relation
arises the Egyptian conception of the number nine? Is it the <em>round</em>

is merely a round number in many instances, but what is still more
certain is that the same expression meaning ‘circle of gods’ and
‘nine gods,’ the circle was supposed to consist of nine gods, and
was enlarged to companies of eighteen or twenty-seven. It is, I am
sure, perfectly idle work to look for more profound reasons for the

A difficult passage, but the readings are unanimous. What
is <img class="hiero" src="images/h264.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />? Brugsch translates it “the Talisman of the Earth,” and
Pierret <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“le salut de la terre.”</span> No objection can be raised against
the truth of either of these meanings taken by itself. But we have
to look at the entire context. The expression literally signifies “the
back of the earth.” In Latin we say <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sinus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gremium</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>viscera terrae</i></span>.

‘Chepera, father of the gods.’ Expressions like this are
liable to be misunderstood by superficial readers. They are not
meant to imply that ‘father of the gods’ was the special attribute of
Chepera. ‘Father of the gods’ is predicated in Chapter 8 of
Sutu, and it is predicated elsewhere of many other divinities. As in
mathematics <em>any</em> point in space may be conceived as the origin of a
given line or surface, so in Egyptian mythology any god may be
rightly called the father of the gods. And for the same reason. The
Day precedes the Night, but not more truly than Night precedes, or
in mythological language <em>gives birth to</em> Day. But we may begin at
Daybreak, or at Noon, or at Sunset, or with the Sun or the Moon,
or with the rising of the Nile or any other natural phenomenon
which obeys an evidently permanent fixed Law.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <i>a</i> the Sun is represented as rising into Heaven, saluted by the
six Cynocephalous Apes. He is also saluted by two goddesses
kneeling. In the Papyrus of Hunefer these goddesses say, “I am
thy sister Isis,” “I am thy sister Nephthys.” The <i>Tat</i> <img class="hiero" src="images/h270.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which is
between them is a symbol <em>both</em> of Osiris and of the East, and in <i>Ba</i>
is replaced by the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h230.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. In the later periods the Dawn was
represented by the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h271.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> consisting of the Sun rising out of the

<p class='c000'>In <i>b</i> the central object is the Sun setting in the West <img class="hiero" src="images/h272.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. He
is saluted by three hawk-headed and by three jackal-headed divinities,
the Spirits of Pu and of Nechen. Below this scene the Sun of
Yesterday and the Sun of To-day in lion forms are saluted by Isis
and Nephthys.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The seventeenth chapter is one of the most remarkable in the
whole collection, and it has been preserved from times previous to
the XIIth dynasty. The very earliest monuments which have
preserved it have handed it down accompanied with scholia and
other commentaries interpolated into the text. Some of the monuments
enable us to some extent to divide the original text from the
additions, in consequence of the latter being written in red. But
there is really only one text where the additions are suppressed,
and which therefore offers the most ancient form, as far as we know
it, of the chapter. This is the copy on the wall of the tomb of
Horhotep. The sarcophagus itself of Horhotep contains a copy of
the text along with the additions. The chapter must already at the
time have been of the most venerable antiquity. Besides these two
copies of the chapter we have those from the sarcophagi of Hora and
Sit-Bastit (published, like those of Horhotep, by M. Maspero<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a>), two
from the sarcophagi of Mentuhotep, and one from that of Sebek-āa
(the three latter published by Lepsius in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Aelteste Texte</cite></span>). The
British Museum has Sir Gardner Wilkinson’s copy of the texts
inscribed on the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep of the XIth dynasty,
and also a fragment (6636 a) of the coffin of a prince named Hornefru.
Here then we have an abundance of witnesses of the best period.
They unfortunately do not agree. The progress of corruption had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>doubt begun long before, and the variants are not simply differences
of orthography but positively different readings. The differences
however are chiefly in the scholia. Even when the explanations of
the text are identical, the form differs. The latest recensions
have retained the form <img class="hiero" src="images/h257.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h377.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h378.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h379.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h381.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />; the ancient added
the feminine <img class="hiero" src="images/h257.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h377.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h378.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h379.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h134.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. <em>What is that?</em> But some of
the ancient texts give the equivalent words <img class="hiero" src="images/h380.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h004.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h257.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and
Horhotep does without them altogether. These words were evidently
additions not merely to the text but to the scholia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The text of the chapter grew more and more obscure to readers,
and the explanations hitherto given were so unsatisfactory as to call
for others. The texts of the manuscripts of the new empire furnish
a good deal of fresh matter, much of which is extremely ancient,
though the proof of this is unfortunately lost through the disastrous
condition of literature in the period preceding the XVIIIth dynasty.
The XVIIIth dynasty and its immediate successors inherited but
did not invent the new form of the Book of the Dead, with its
succession of vignettes, which however differing in detail bear the
stamp of a common traditional teaching. The manuscripts of a later
period bear witness, with reference to this as well as to other chapters,
to a recension of an authoritative kind. The text becomes more
certain though perhaps not either more true or more intelligible,
and the notes and explanations have here reached their fullest extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would take an entire volume to give the translations of all the
forms the chapter has assumed. It must be sufficient here to give
the earliest forms known to us of the text and of the first commentaries.
These are printed in characters which show the difference between
text and later additions; all of which, it must be remembered, are of
extreme antiquity--some <em>two thousand years</em> before any probable
date of Moses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Explanations or other interesting matter occurring in the manuscripts
of the later Empire will be referred to in the notes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The title in the early copies is the simple one here heading the
chapter. In those which begin at the XVIIIth dynasty the title is
very like that given for the first chapter. The chief additions are
that the deceased person “<em>takes every form that he pleases, plays
draughts, and sits in a bower, comes forth as a soul living after death,
and that what is done upon earth is glorified</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><a id='note17.1'/><a href='#nref17.1'>1.</a>
It would be difficult for us to imagine that the very remarkable
opening of the chapter is an addition. Yet it is unknown to the
primitive recension on the walls of Horhotep’s tomb, though found
everywhere else. The texts however which contain it do not agree.
“I am He who closeth, and He who openeth, and I am but One.”
‘He who closeth’ is <img class="hiero" src="images/h273.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>Tmu</i>, ‘He who openeth’ <img class="hiero" src="images/h274.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>Unen</i>.
As the god who closes and who opens is one and the same, ‘I am
but One,’ is a very natural ending of the sentence, and for its sense
the whole may appeal to classical, and higher than classical, authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The meaning of the Egyptian is quite plain, but the readings
most probably through the absence of determinatives in the
oldest style are somewhat different. Horhotep and other texts have
<img class="hiero" src="images/h273.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h154.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h275.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, apparently as one word (compounded of <i>tmu</i>
and <i>unen</i>), which may signify the ‘closer and opener,’ but Sebek-āa and
later texts have <img class="hiero" src="images/h273.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h274.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h099.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The papyrus of Nebseni
has <img class="hiero" src="images/h274.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h072.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, in the third person, which does not alter the meaning,
but this is quite an isolated reading. The later recension, as represented
by the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span> and the Cadet papyrus, has <img class="hiero" src="images/h274.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which
only prominently brings forward, what is implied in all the other
texts, that the Opener is a god.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The absence of the determinative
<img class="hiero" src="images/h276.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> after <img class="hiero" src="images/h274.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is no objection to the sense ‘opener,’ especially after
<img class="hiero" src="images/h273.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. It is absolutely necessary when dealing with mythology
to look to physical rather than to metaphysical meanings. I have
sufficiently discussed the meanings of the word <img class="hiero" src="images/h277.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> in my essay on
the Myth of Osiris Unnefer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The later recensions add an interpolation (not without very different
readings) to the effect that the Sun made his first appearance
when Shu raised the Sky from the height of Chemennu, where he
destroyed the ‘Children of Failure’ <img class="hiero" src="images/h278.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h279.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h470.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c000'>The raising of the Sky by Shu is very frequently represented in
pictures. Seb (the Earth) and Nut (the Sky) have been sleeping in
each other’s arms during the night; Shu (Daylight at sunrise) parts
them, and the sky is seen to be raised high above the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'><img class="hiero" src="images/h280.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, Shu, who is of course the son of Râ, is in consequence
of this act called <img class="hiero" src="images/h281.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h282.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>Ȧn-ḥeru</i>, ‘The Lifter up of the Heaven.’</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Chemennu</em> is the geographical name of the town called by the
Greeks Hermopolis. The mystical Chemennu, however, is alone
referred to in this place. The word itself means Eight, and Lepsius
sees here a reference to eight elementary deities. (We must remember
that the passage itself is an interpolation, of which there is no
trace in the older texts.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The ‘children of <em>Failure</em>’ <span class='xlarge'>(</span><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h284.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h470.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h190.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h284.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h285.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>deficere</i></span>,

vanish at the appearance of Day. This mythological expression here
found in an interpolated passage is met later on in a genuine portion
of the older text.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note17.2'/><a href='#nref17.2'>2.</a>
It would be impossible to find a more emphatic assertion of
the doctrine of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nomina Numina</i></span>; and that more than 3000 years
before Christ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Names</em> of Râ, the Sun-god, are said, when taken together,
to compose ‘the cycle of the gods.’ <img class="hiero" src="images/h076.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h077.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. Or the names
which he has created, to which he has given rise, that is the names of
all the solar phenomena, recurring as they do, day after day, to the
eyes of all beholders, compose “the cycle of the gods,” who are also
called the limbs or members of Râ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scholia contained in the papyri of the XVIIIth and later
dynasties explain the text as follows:--</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“It is Râ as he creates the <em>names</em> of his <em>limbs</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h287.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which
<em>become</em> the gods who accompany him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the present chapter later on says of Chepera, the rising
Sun, that the “cycle of the gods is his body.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The god who has hitherto been spoken of is Râ. In glaring contradiction
to the whole text, a later note states that the resistless god
is “the Water, which is <i>Nu</i>”; that is Heaven.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> <img class="hiero" src="images/h288.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h096.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>Nu</i>
is not alluded to at all in the primitive text, but the papyrus of
Nebseni already exhibits the corruption of the fine passage, “I am
he who closeth and he who openeth, and I am but One.” This is
itself an addition, the true meaning of which was afterwards destroyed
by the interpolation of the words <img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h288.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h096.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. These are
ambiguous. They might mean that the god was alone ‘in heaven,’
or that he was alone ‘<em>as</em> Heaven.’ The papyrus of Ani has
<img class="hiero" src="images/h226.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h275.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h288.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h096.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, “I was born from Nu.” These
attempted improvements do not give a favourable impression of the
exegetical acumen of Egyptian theologians.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the mention of ‘Water’ in the scholion has nothing whatever
to do with the doctrine of Thales, and to suppose that it has implies
a confusion between two very different realms of human thought.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note17.3'/><a href='#nref17.3'>3.</a>
‘The kinsman of the Morrow,’ literally ‘I know the Morrow.’

<p class='c000'>The papyrus of Nebseni and all the subsequent texts give the
explanation that Yesterday means Osiris, and the Morrow means Râ.
And the vignette in the papyrus of Ani gives the name of Yesterday

The earliest texts have either <img class="hiero" src="images/h291.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> ‘speak,’ or <img class="hiero" src="images/h292.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> ‘command.’
The meaning is the same in both readings. Strife arose
among the gods at the bidding of Râ: that is every force in nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>began its appropriate career of activity, necessarily coming into contact
and conflict with the other forces. And of all this collision the
first cause, the origin of all activity and motion, is the Sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>This mythological cosmology reminds one of the saying of
Heraclitos that  “Strife is the father and the king of all things,” and
the doctrine that all becoming must be conceived as the product
of warring opposites--παν´ντα κατ’ ἔριν γίνεσθαι.</p>

The Heron is the bird called <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h293.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h056.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>bennu</i>, the numerous
pictures of which enable us to identify it with the Common Heron
or Heronshaw. The reason for connecting this bird with the Sun-god
has to be sought in the etymology of its name. <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h294.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ben</i> is a

a ring, also a ‘round pill.’ The Sun therefore is very naturally
called <i>bennu</i>, an appellative like κυκλοέλικτος in the Orphic hymns.</p>

<p class='c000'><img class="hiero" src="images/h296.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h297.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, ‘of that which is, and of that which cometh into
being.’ Here, as in many other places, <img class="hiero" src="images/h277.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" />, which is a verb of
motion, and really signifies ‘rise up, spring forth,’ is pointedly distinguished
from <img class="hiero" src="images/h298.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, that which (is). So far from signifying
‘being, that which is,’ it very much more nearly corresponds to <img class="hiero" src="images/h299.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
in the frequent expression <img class="hiero" src="images/h300.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h299.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, ‘that which is and that which

The reading of the name <img class="hiero" src="images/h301.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is proved by the numerous

Mehurit is explained in the ancient scholion as ‘the Eye,’
but it is really the Sky, from which the Sun is born daily. The sign
of plurality after Mehurit (if it means anything) only indicates the
daily succession of the skies whence Râ is born.</p>

The ‘coffined One’ <img class="hiero" src="images/h330.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h331.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h332.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is of course Osiris, as
it is plainly stated in the later scholia, which further add that the
‘Seven glorious ones’ who follow the coffin, or, as they read it, “their
Lord,” are to be sought in the constellation of ‘the Thigh in the
northern sky,’ that is in the seven stars of the Great Bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>These stars never set, but are perpetually revolving round the
Pole. It is therefore evidently with the Polar Star that we must
identify the coffin of Osiris. The names of the Seven Glorious ones

receive other mythical forms; that of the Seven Cows and
their Bull is recorded in the 148th chapter. Names like ‘the Red-eyed’
<img class="hiero" src="images/h333.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h334.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h036.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or the ‘Red-haired’ cow <img class="hiero" src="images/h333.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h335.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> seem to

<p class='c000'>The papyri add the important note that the “day of Come thou
hither”! represents the moment “when Osiris says to Râ, Come

It is most probable that the Cat became the representative of

‘shining’ said of the Sun. But the Egyptian scribe gives a different
etymological explanation. Sau said of Râ “he is <img class="hiero" src="images/h341.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>maȧu</i> of what

or the prototype, the copy or the original. The creatures of Râ
were made after his likeness. Sanskrit literature, from the Çatapatha
Brahmana down to the Vishnu Purâna, is full of similar etymologies.
The Egyptians from the very first delighted in this play upon words.</p>

<img class="hiero" src="images/h351.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> ‘victuals.’ The god is one of the forty-two judges of the dead,

source of the Nile. The serpent <img class="hiero" src="images/h140.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which is a most frequent
determinative of the name, is an additional reason for identifying
this god with the Nile: a conclusion which seems fully justified

See M. Naville’s collation. In the papyrus of Ani the chapter is

<p class='c000'>The eighteenth chapter is one of those found in the earliest
copies of the Book of the Dead, on the wooden coffins of the ‘Old’
and ‘Middle’ Empires; the most complete ancient copy being on
the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep of the eleventh dynasty.</p>

<p class='c000'>It consists of a Litany addressed to Thoth, who is invoked for
securing the triumph of the departed against his adversaries in
presence of the gods of certain localities. Each petition has
reference to some mythological event, and is supplemented by the
enumeration of the gods constituting the divine company presiding
at the locality named, and sometimes by a short comment on the
myth referred to.</p>

<p class='c000'>The order of petitions is somewhat different in the later recensions,
and the text has suffered other alterations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Copies of this chapter are extremely numerous, particularly in
the later periods.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chapter really begins with the petitions to Thoth. The
preceding portion is, as far as I know, found only in the Papyrus of
Ani. But as the vignette which belongs to this portion has a place
in the great Leyden Papyrus of Kenna, the text cannot have been
confined to a single manuscript. It is particularly valuable as
illustrative of the ritual use of portions of the Book of the Dead.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note18.1'/><a href='#nref18.1'>1.</a>
The deceased person is supposed to be presented to the gods
by two priests in succession, one called <i>An-maut-ef</i> <img class="hiero" src="images/h392.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1992.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h349.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h072.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,

Horus, and it is the usual thing for Egyptian priests to bear divine
titles; their ritual observances being dramatic and symbolical
representations of the actions of the gods. <i>An-maut-ef</i> literally
signifies ‘column (support) of his mother.’ Horus is called

Company of the gods’ (Mariette, <cite>Abydos</cite>, I, p. 34), and in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Denkmäler</cite></span>,
III, 206 <i>e</i>, he is called the <i>An-maut-ef</i> of Osiris (<i>cf.</i> <cite>Abyd.</cite> II, 54).</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Se-meri-f</i> signifies ‘the Beloved Son,’ and the priest of this
name in the funereal rites personified Horus in his dutiful offices
to his father Osiris. I do not know why <img class="hiero" src="images/h393.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h394.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is <em>always</em>
translated ‘the son who loves him,’ instead of  ‘the son he loves,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>which is the right meaning. <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h396.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h394.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is ‘the place which he

‘the wife whom he loves,’ not ‘who loves him.’</p>

more extended notice of this feminine word, which is a collective
noun, and never found in any other sense.</p>

The names of these two animals (especially of the second)
vary greatly in the texts. But if we wish rightly to understand the
sense of the chapter, we must bear in mind that it is not the animals
themselves that are meant, but the characteristics implied by the
names of the animals. And as the Sanskrit <i>vṛkas</i>, the Greek λύκος,
the old Slavonic <i>vluku</i>, the Gothic <i>vulfs</i>, and our own <em>wolf</em>, signify
the <em>robber</em>, so does the Egyptian <img class="hiero" src="images/h464.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h463.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h171.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, whether signifying
<em>wolf</em>, <em>wolfhound</em>, or <em>bloodhound</em>, indicate <em>speed</em>.</p>

they stand for hyænas <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h410.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h465.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, or for other animals of the

And what must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>we understand under the latter term? We must look to the context.
It is of a god speaking of himself and of his attributes. He is proud
of them, and certainly does not wish them to be taken in a bad
sense. Nor is it necessary that we should do so. We have only to
remember what we learnt at school.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cicero (<cite>de Sen.</cite>, 10, 33) contrasts the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘ferocitas juvenum,’</span> the
high <em>pluck</em> of the young, with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘infirmitas puerorum,’</span> and the

written <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ȧb</i>, and <img class="hiero" src="images/h483.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> also written <img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h145.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and
<img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h144.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ḥatu</i>.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The two words are commonly used synonymously,
but they are sometimes pointedly distinguished one from
the other. Etymologically <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ȧb</i> is connected with the sense
of lively motion <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h484.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ȧb</i>, like the Greek καρδία, κραδίη, (δία τὸ
ἀπαύστως σαλεύεσθαι) with κραδάω and κραδαίνω. Other Indo-European
names, our own <em>heart</em>, the Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cor</i></span> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cord-is</i></span>), the Sanskrit
<i>hṛd</i>, and the corresponding Slavonic and Lithuanian names have
the same origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the orthography of <img class="hiero" src="images/h483.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> it seems to have been connected
in popular opinion with its position in the anterior part of the body.
And from various uses of the word it appears to denote not merely
the heart, but the heart with all that is attached to it, especially the
<em>lungs</em> which embrace it. It is for instance to the <img class="hiero" src="images/h483.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h175.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> that <em>air</em> is
conducted according to the medical Papyri. And it is not improbable
that <img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h252.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h485.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h145.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h485.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h486.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, organs of respiration, are
closely connected words.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>But perhaps the best argument may be found in the Vignettes of
chapter 28, where the two lungs are actually drawn as in the hieratic
papyrus (Pl. 2) published by Sir Charles Nicholson. In others (as
Leyden, T. 16) even the larynx is visible. (See <a href='#pl10'>Plate X</a>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The Italian word <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>corata</i></span> is immortalised through its occurrence

earliest and in the latest papyri. But some texts have simply <img class="hiero" src="images/h1622.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" />,
which is certainly a mistake, and others omit the conjunction before
the verb. The sense is not much affected by this omission.

identified with the Coptic <span class='large'>ⲕⲓⲟⲱⲩ</span>, <em>amaranthus</em>. In several copies
of this chapter the name of the plant is followed by the geographical
determinative <img class="hiero" src="images/h491.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which is really implied in the context. Was
this mythological ‘mead of amaranth’ suggested by the Oasis and
its vegetation?</p>

This sentence is a repetition (in other words) of the preceding

M. Naville pointed out the fact that in some of the oldest MSS.
the particle <img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> did not occur. It now appears that the particle is
not found in any of the older MSS., and I have also found it
omitted in hieratic papyri. The passage therefore must be translated
differently, and this is possible through a slight change in the

in the Pyramid Texts (Teta 39). We have no means of determining
the exact sense of this word, which as an appellative expresses an
attribute possessed both by the Sun and by the fruit, foliage, or
other parts of the tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like many other portions of the book this chapter is hopelessly

They have probably mixed up different recensions without regard to

The last words of the chapter were extremely puzzling to the
scribes of the later periods, who altered them in ever so many ways.
The older MSS. read <img class="hiero" src="images/h518.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h519.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero-b" src="images/h1994.jpg" height="36" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h334.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h134.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h520.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h257.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h521.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h522.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h520.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.
And this is borrowed from an ancient text, which
may be found on the sarcophagus of Horhotep, line 338. The
variants <img class="hiero" src="images/h518.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h523.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h518.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h524.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, of the papyri, and <img class="hiero" src="images/h525.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h526.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> of the
sarcophagus show that it is the sacrificial joint which is meant, and
not a verb as the scribes of a later period thought. For this verb
they had to discover an object and accordingly we find <img class="hiero" src="images/h518.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h171.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h275.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h252.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h353.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h527.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
‘I trod <em>their caverns</em>.’ <img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h437.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> was in like

These gods are mentioned in the Pyramid Texts in a passage
closely resembling this one of the Book of the Dead. “They bring
to Unas (line 479) the four Glorious ones who are on the side lock
of Horus; who stand upon the Eastern side of Heaven, and who
are conspicuous through their sceptres <img class="hiero" src="images/h542.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h543.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h543.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h543.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.

very imperfect in this place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word <img class="hiero" src="images/h545.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h546.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> appears to have the sense of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>insignire</i></span>,

Egyptian court, but here they minister to Osiris in the Netherworld.
They are apparently the same gods who are addressed in the

The determinative <img class="hiero" src="images/h550.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> shows that <img class="hiero" src="images/h551.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is here to be taken
in the sense of the duration of human life, and the pronominal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>suffixes <img class="hiero" src="images/h099.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h072.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> show whose life is spoken of. The latter

translated in the singular. The plural sign merely indicates a
common or collective noun.</p>

It was on the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, but M. Naville gives the

<p class='c000'>This chapter is in even worse condition than the one which
precedes it. There are a few scraps of it on a coffin at St. Petersburg
which M. Golenischeff assigns to the earliest period. The
only early MS. which is of any use, <i>Ba</i>, the Berlin papyrus of
Nechtuamon, is here in a very mutilated condition, as may be seen
on referring to M. Naville’s edition.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note32.1'/><a href='#nref32.1'>1.</a>
<em>Osiris standeth up upon his feet.</em> So <i>Ba</i>; but the coffin at
St. Petersburg lends its support to the text of Bekenrenef (of the]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>26th Dynasty), which opens the chapter with the name of a crocodile

belly”!</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note32.2'/><a href='#nref32.2'>2.</a>
The ancient text had only four crocodiles, and only four are
mentioned in the text of Bekenrenef. The Turin text speaks of
eight; two for each of the cardinal points. But the Saitic text
already has two invocations instead of one for each crocodile.</p>

The sense of this myth is obvious. Every star which <em>sets</em> is
supposed to be swallowed by the Crocodile of the West. It was

The MS. which contains it, <i>Ca</i>, suggests another reading <i>Tenpua</i> with
<img class="hiero" src="images/h501.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, the determinative of <em>plants</em>. This not proving satisfactory,

The name of
this deity is generally translated Lynx, and it is certainly applied to
an animal of the feline species closely resembling the cat. But the

<em>They wait apart.</em> The early MSS. do not agree here in a

<p class='c013'><a id='note35.4'/><a href='#nref35.4'>4.</a>
<em>Bruised</em>, or <em>trodden</em>. There being no rational context it is
impossible to fix the sense of a word like <img class="hiero" src="images/h620.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h619.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026c.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which may

<em>Cleansing</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h622.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026d.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h621.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026d.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The result of the process
is certainly <em>cleansing</em>, but the operation itself is generally supposed
to be <em>washing</em>. This agrees with the Coptic ⲣⲁϩⲧ <em>a fuller</em>, of
which the old Egyptian form is <img class="hiero" src="images/h621.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026d.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. But ⲣⲁϩⲧ has also
the sense of <em>beating</em>, and the operation is in many countries thought
to be one of the most important duties of washerwomen. With
this sense of the word I would connect the names <i>Rechit</i> given to
Isis and Nephthys, as signifying ‘mourners.’ Compare the Greek
τύπτεσθαί τινα, κόπτεσθαί τινα, <em>to mourn a person</em>, and the Latin
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plangere</i></span>.</p>

these words is unambiguous. <img class="hiero" src="images/h624.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h171.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> signifies literally ‘standing,’
like <em>status</em>, or στάσις, and like those words also signifies
position, situation, condition, circumstances, and also the point at
issue, the question to be decided.</p>

<p class='c000'>A well known passage in Cicero’s <cite>Topics</cite> (93, c. 35) may be

<p class='c000'>There are two recensions of this chapter, and both are found in
the papyrus <i>Lb</i>. They are called by M. Naville, 38<span class='fss'>A</span> and 38<span class='fss'>B</span>. The
latter is that adopted as canonical by all the manuscripts of a later
date, and is the one here translated. The other recension is longer,
and contains passages which are also found in other chapters, to
which it accordingly furnishes important variants. It may possibly
be older than those chapters.</p>

sun sets, and <em>extending through the earth</em> as far as where the sun
rises. Each end of the tunnel has a sphinx-like form. A human-headed

<p class='c000'>The translation of this chapter is based upon the important
papyrus T 5 of Leyden, known as <i>Lb</i>. This is the only MS. which
contains the whole chapter. All other copies begin after the sixth
line. The usual chapter begins in <i>Lb</i> with a <img class="hiero" src="images/h670.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h291.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which is
the ordinary way of indicating a various reading. But the difference
of reading applies rather to a mere paragraph than to the whole
chapter. In this case we should expect <img class="hiero" src="images/h671.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /> or something equivalent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Eater of the Ass is a Serpent, but who is the Ass?</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, as in each case of mythological name, the animal is not
meant, but something which is connoted by it. The name of the ass
is given to it in consequence of one of its characteristics. It is
<img class="hiero" src="images/h196a.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h321.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h672.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. But this is one of the seventy-five names of the
Sun-god in the Solar Litany.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a> And he derives this appellation from
his fructifying power.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the Ass is the Sun, who is the <em>Eater</em> of the Ass? This
must be Darkness or Eclipse of some kind.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note40.1'/><a href='#nref40.1'>1.</a>
<i>Haiu</i>, the serpent who devours the sun, is undoubtedly the
same as <img class="hiero" src="images/h002.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h140.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>Haiu</i>, the serpent who in the Pyramid texts is
ordered to lie down (Unas, 545, &amp;c.), and cease from his attacks.</p>

 <em>The god Chas</em>, <img class="hiero" src="images/h673.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h674.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note40.3'/><a href='#nref40.3'>3.</a>
 The usual chapter begins here. The text of <i>Lb</i> has generally
been followed, but in some places later authorities have been
preferred.</p>

The horns here spoken of, as possessed by a viper, are those of the
deadly Cerastes, which are spines projecting from the arched eye-brows
of the creature. See picture in Long’s <cite>Egyptian Antiquities
of British Museum</cite>, II, p. 316, copied from the great French work.</p>

<img class="hiero" src="images/h686.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and <img class="hiero" src="images/h687.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. And the last of these is possibly a corrupt
reading from <img class="hiero" src="images/h688.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h689.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The first two are synonymous. <img class="hiero" src="images/h685.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
may in certain contexts mean <em>destroy</em>, but it only signifies ‘bring to
a limit, to an end, stop,’ like the τερ in τερ-μα, <i>ter-min-o</i>. It is used
in many cases, such as the staunching of blood, where no destruction
is intended. <img class="hiero" src="images/h690.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h691.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h044.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h692.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h693.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is <em>stop in thy place</em>.</p>

<em>Tablets</em>, <img class="hiero" src="images/h146.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h278.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h697.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. These are the tablets on which Thoth
has written down the evidence taken at the <em>Weighing of the Words</em>,
the examination at the Psychostasia. They are mentioned again at
the end of Chapter 41.</p>

be seen in another way. Tmu is the god invoked, and in answer he

<p class='c000'>This chapter is in itself most interesting, and it is one of the
most important as illustrative of Egyptian mythology. It is impossible
at present to explain every detail, but the general drift of the
chapter is not to be mistaken. And the same drift is to be recognised
in the whole course of Egyptian religious literature from the
beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker throughout identifies himself with the divinity whose
manifestation is the Sun; he is not the Sun of this or that moment
but of Yesterday, To-day and of all eternity, the “One proceeding
from the One.”</p>

<em>The god within the Tamarisk.</em> The rising sun under his

<p class='c000'>The antiquity of the chapter is proved by its occurrence on the
second coffin of Mentuhotep; but its condition there is such that
no one can read it who is not already familiar with it from other
sources. It begins, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Aelteste Texte</cite></span>, p. 22, line 34, and goes on till
the red letters at line 50. The text, in spite of its importance, is

<em>The four fastenings.</em> The number <em>four</em> is only found in the
oldest copies. The later copies have a different text. It is impossible
to say <em>what</em> kind of fastening is meant. <img class="hiero" src="images/h109.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> might be a
ligament or a vertebra--though more probably the latter. But it
might be a combination of several pieces. <img class="hiero" src="images/h316.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h430.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is the
occiput, and this suggests the hypothesis of cervical vertebrae. But
the number of these is not four but seven. Of these <em>three</em> are
peculiar; the Atlas which supports the head, the Axis upon which
the head turns, and the Vertebra prominens with its long spinal
process. But see the Vignette of chapter 42 from <i>Pd</i> where four
vertebrae are figured.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chapters numbered 51 and 52 are not found in the most
ancient papyri, but the substance of them and their formulas are
met with on the ancient coffins<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a> and in the Pyramid texts. See, for
instance, Unas 189, Teta 68, with M. Maspero’s note on the latter
text. I do not, however, believe, as M. Maspero does, that these
texts convey the idea “so frequent[!] among half-civilised peoples,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of another life in which the deceased will have nothing to eat and
drink but excremental matter.” That the <img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h752.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which I translate

are objects of abhorrence to the Sun-god, like the dead rat and the
putrid cat in chapter 33, because he is a consuming fire, and “whatsoever
he findeth upon his path he devoureth it,” <img class="hiero" src="images/h334.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h754.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h755.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h756.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h757.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h089.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h121.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
Unas 515. It is only natural then that the
deceased who is identified with the Sun-god in these texts should
express his execration of such offensive matter. He is not afraid
of being limited to this food, his fear springs from the opposite
extreme.</p>

<p class='c000'>The text here followed is that of <i>Pa</i> which is much preferable to
that of Ani. There is a far older text, that of Horhotep, line 344
and <i>sqq.</i>, but it is too inaccurate to serve as the basis of a translation.
It is however very valuable for other purposes.</p>

<em>The god in Lion form.</em> These words are not in Horhotep,
the chapter beginning as in later texts “Oh Tmu let there come to
me the air which is in thy nostrils.” The word for air is written
<img class="hiero" src="images/h134.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h772.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> (lines 344 and 346) as in other places.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note54.2'/><a href='#nref54.2'>2.</a>
It is a mistake to speak of a <em>mundane</em> egg, of which there is
no trace in Egyptian mythology. Seb, the great cackling goose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>lays the golden egg, which is the Sun; but <img class="hiero" src="images/h528.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h777.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> does not mean
‘lay upon the earth,’ but ‘<em>divide</em>, <em>separate</em> from the earth.’ The egg
springs from the back of Seb.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note54.3'/><a href='#nref54.3'>3.</a>
<em>Who keepeth opposition in equipoise.</em> This sense may be
inferred from <i>Pa</i>, but is made very clear by the <img class="hiero" src="images/h773.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h774.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h775.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h776.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />

exactly corresponds to the Egyptian, for the word <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>azure</i></span> is derived

<p class='c000'>Ancients and modern differ greatly, as is well known, from each
other as to the impressions derived from colour. It seems strange to
read in the tale of the <em>Destruction of Mankind</em> that the ‘hair of Râ
was of real <i>chesbet</i>,’ that is ‘dark blue.’ But we have an exact parallel
to this in Greek. Κύανος is <i>lapis lazuli</i> in Theophrastus, who
even mentions the artificial lapis made in Egypt. But in the
Homeric poems the hair of Hector (<cite>Il.</cite>, 22, 401), and the hair and
beard of Odysseus (<cite>Od.</cite>, 16, 176), as well as the eyebrows of Zeus
(<cite>Il.</cite>,1, 528; 17, 209) are described as κυάνεαι.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is one of the most important as it is one of the most ancient
chapters. The text of it was already doubtful at the time of the
XIth dynasty. It had been handed down in two recensions, both
of which were inscribed on the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, the
discovery of one of these being attributed to the time of King Septa
of the 1st dynasty, and that of the second to the time of Menkaurâ,
the king of the third pyramid. These two recensions are also found
in the papyrus of Nebseni. The MSS. present innumerable various
readings, few of which are of the slightest value. These have been
collected, as far as they could be discovered, in the French and
some other Museums in 1876, in a very admirable work upon the
chapter, by M. Paul Guieysse,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c010'><sup>[76]</sup></a> who has translated and commented
upon it and and all the variations of it known to him at the time.
Since then the papyrus of Nebseni has been published, and M.
Naville has given all the variants found in the few existing papyri of
the best period. I have notes of the readings of the papyri in the
British Museum, and also those of a cast (now in the British
Museum) taken from a block in serpentine, belonging to the
Museum of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>With such light as could be derived from these extremely divergent
authorities I have done my best (taking as the basis of my
translation the texts in the papyrus of Nebseni and the rubric in which
the discovery is ascribed to the time of king Septa) towards exhibiting
the chapter in as intelligible a form as seems to me possible.
Some passages as yet defy translation in consequence of the corruption
of the text.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years before his untimely death M. de Rougé read his
translation of this chapter before the Académie des Sciences. It is
much to be lamented that this has never been published. I have,
in addition to the versions of other scholars, a copy of one by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Mr. Goodwin, with whom I read this and other chapters nearly
thirty years ago. But this kind of literature is not one of those in
which his marvellous sagacity showed to advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reading this and almost every other chapter of the <cite>Book of
the Dead</cite>, it is absolutely necessary to bear in mind that different
divine names do not necessarily imply different personalities.
A name expresses but <em>one</em> attribute of a person or thing, and one
person having several attributes may have several names. It is not
implied in this chapter that the Sun is the Nile or the Inundation,
but that the same invisible force which is manifested in the solar
phenomena is that which produces the inundation; He is the
Inundator. But he has many other names and titles.
In this chapter, as in others before it, the speaker at one time
talks in terms identifying him with some divinity, and at another as
a simple mortal petitioning some favour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first part of this chapter is nearly identical with Chapter 2.
No copy of it is found in the papyri of the older period. In place
of it M. Naville has published a chapter bearing the same title, and
which is found in five ancient papyri. These texts however are
extremely discordant and corrupt, and in the more difficult, and to
us more interesting, passages must have been quite unintelligible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the copyists. The second word, for instance, of line 8 is <i>ri</i> in <i>Ca</i>,
the corresponding word is ..  <i>ḥtu</i> in <i>Ta</i>, <i>ṭāi</i> in <i>Pb</i>, <i>rāu</i> in <i>Ia</i> and <i>ḥti</i> in
<i>Aa</i>. A discrepancy not less violent is encountered after the next
three words. The oldest extant form of the chapter is that of <i>Aa</i>,
the papyrus of Nebseni; it is also the shortest, and the other forms
appear to me to exhibit signs of interpolation. But M. Naville was
quite right in taking the text of <i>Ca</i> as his basis for the collation of
the texts.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note65.1'/><a href='#nref65.1'>1.</a>
This whole passage, as it stands, in the MSS. is extremely
obscure, and I can only make sense of it by conjecturing that a
preposition has been omitted by the copyists.</p>

<p class='c000'>The knees of a goddess are frequently mentioned in connection
with the birth of a divinity. Here the Babe is mentioned (<i>cf.</i> opening
of Chapter 42), and the closing of the knees. The word <i>ānḫ</i>, ‘live,’
has for its primitive meaning ‘rise up,’ and it is in this sense that
I translate it here.</p>

This passage explains what is meant in Chapter 28 by the <em>god
of the Broad Face</em>. One of the papyri (<i>Ia</i>) adds the well known epithet
of the setting sun <img class="hiero" src="images/h943.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h038.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> ‘old.’</p>

<p class='c000'>It is Hathor who proceeds to Heliopolis, as the feminine suffix

<p class='c013'><a id='note68.4'/><a href='#nref68.4'>4.</a>
M. Lefébure (Papyrus de Soutimès, p. 3, note 8) understands
the passage as meaning “<em>I seek</em> the direction of <em>the wind</em> in order to
avoid it.” But I am inclined to recognize a superstition still current
among sailors, the “whistling for a breeze.”</p>

The title as here translated is taken from the oldest known
MS., that of Nebseni. But the Papyrus <i>Pc</i>, which is of the same
period, has “<i>Chapter for entering after going forth by day, and for
making transformations in all forms</i>,” and this title or a very similar
one is found on other papyri. The most recent form is that in the
Turin copy--<i>Chapter for coming forth by day and repelling brute
Force, so that the person may not be seized in the Netherworld, but
that his soul may be made sound in the Ta-t’ eserit.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note71.2'/><a href='#nref71.2'>2.</a>
<em>Lord of Mehurit</em> = Lord of Heaven, that is the Sun-god. The
invocation is repeated a little farther on, “O thou who circlest within
thine Egg, Lord of Mehurit.” The god is also said to be the owner
of “the Two Twin Souls,” namely Rā and Osiris.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span><a id='note71.3'/><a href='#nref71.3'>3.</a>
The verb is here in the second person, not in the first. This
is shown by those texts which give the name of the person, instead
of the pronominal suffix, as the object of the verb.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note71.4'/><a href='#nref71.4'>4.</a>
<em>Thyself</em> = Here, in all but the later copies, the pronoun of the
third person is used, in accordance with a well known Egyptian
idiom.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note71.5'/><a href='#nref71.5'>5.</a>
<em>Lord of the One Face</em> = μονοπρόσωπος in opposition to πολυπρόσωπος
which is an epithet of the Sky, on account of its many
changes of aspect. The Moon too has a variety of phases, whereas
the Sun is eminently the “Lord of One Face.” From another point
of view the god, at the beginning of chapter 64, is called the “Lord
of Two Faces,” the bright and the dark. The Pyramid Texts have
the parallel conception of the Two Eyes of Horus, one white and
one black, <img class="hiero" src="images/h944.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h944.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h308.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h945.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h946.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> (Unas 37).</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note71.6'/><a href='#nref71.6'>6.</a>
This passage receives illustration from the great inscription of
Piānchi, who at Heliopolis paid a visit to the great Tabernacle
(<img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h947.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h479.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />) of the Sun-god, the doors of which he opened and
afterwards sealed up with the royal seal. Before going up the steps
to it he had to lift the <em>Vail</em> (<img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h216.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h437.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />) or Curtains which concealed
it, and perform sprinklings and offer incense and flowers.
Two important words (of which the first has the interesting variant
<img class="hiero" src="images/h948.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and the second is written <img class="hiero" src="images/h949.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h338.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> in the oldest texts) are
thus made clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The god is said, according to the different readings, to pierce
“through, the Vail” or “through <em>what is upon</em> the Vail.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be remembered that the Hebrew Holy of Holies was
separated from the Sanctuary by a curtain upon which the figures of
Cherubim were woven, that before the curtain of the Holy of Holies
stood the altar upon which incense was offered each morn and
evening, and that in sin-offerings the priest sprinkled blood seven
times before the Vail of the Sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c000'>This chapter is often found not only in papyri but upon coffins,
in accordance with the rubric at the end. The earliest copy is on
the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep. A very fine copy is on the alabaster
sarcophagus of Seti I, and our museums are rich in funereal
monuments inscribed with this ancient text. A very similar text is
found at the end of chapter 99.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note72.1'/><a href='#nref72.1'>1.</a>
<i>Ammehit</i> is the name given in chapter 149 to the sixth abode
in Amenta, but here and in other places it is simply one of the
names of the Netherworld. In the inscriptions, for instance, of the
tomb of Queen Tita,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a> “passing through the two folding doors of the
Ammehit” is in parallelism with “going in and out of the divine
Netherworld.”</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note72.2'/><a href='#nref72.2'>2.</a>
<em>Lords of Rule.</em> This is the reading in most documents, but
there are others which have an equal claim to authority. The invocation
is sometimes made to the <img class="hiero" src="images/h952.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h953.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> “those who are possessed
of a <i>ka</i>,” that is the “spirits made perfect,” those who have already
passed through the requisite trials, besides the gods who have never
passed through the stage of mortality, all of whom are possessed
of a <i>ka</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The invocation, according to another reading, which is that of
chapter 99, is addressed to the <img class="hiero" src="images/h954.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h728.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h953.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> “those who are
beautiful or perfect of <i>ka</i>.” Here the papyri add <em>lords of rule</em>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the invocation, whatever the reading may be, is always addressed to
those who have in their power the laws which regulate the universe.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note72.3'/><a href='#nref72.3'>3.</a>
<em>Whose secular period is Eternity.</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h955.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h956.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ḥentȧ</i> is the
period of 120 years (see <cite>Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.</cite>, XIV, 264) which
was their αἰών, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>aevum</i></span>, corresponding in idea, not in actual time, to
our century. The secular period of the gods is eternity.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note72.4'/><a href='#nref72.4'>4.</a>
<em>The Crocodile.</em> Are we to understand this of the crocodile-headed

These pictures are not known to us from as early a date as the
chapter itself, but they may have existed. Perhaps, however, this
passage may have suggested them.</p>

<em>Bread.</em> The Egyptian word <img class="hiero" src="images/h957.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>ta</i>, like its homonym <img class="hiero" src="images/h958.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
implies something <em>pierced</em> or <em>perforated</em>. The sacrificial cake חַלָּה
in Leviticus viii, 26 has the same meaning and, like חַלִיל <em>a pipe</em>, is
connected with חָלָל, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>perforavit</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>confodit</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>aperuit</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>profanavit</i></span>. See

<em>The Leg.</em> In this place, as in chapter 98 and other texts, a
constellation in the northern sky is meant, which many years ago I
identified with Cassiopeia.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>This constellation, according to chapter 98, is in the Northern
sky and in the <em>Great Stream</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h960.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h196.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, by which I understand
the “Milky Way.” This position is also in accordance with the
ancient text on the Coffin of Amamu, pl. XXVI, line 22. The <em>Leg</em>
is as close to the Pole as the Great Bear (called the <em>Thigh</em> in
Egyptian Astronomy) but in the opposite direction, and in consequence
of this position it never sets below the horizon. Hence in
the Pyramid Texts (Pepi I, 411 and Merenrā 589) it is called

was obtained.</p>

This is the first of a series of chapters relative to the “Transformations,”
the subject of which is treated in the Introduction. It
is sufficient here to repeat that the Egyptian ‘Transformations’ have
nothing in common with Metempsychosis, as understood in the
Greek or Indian religions. The change of form in the Egyptian
idea depended upon the will of the person; it was not a penance
for sin, but a means of glorification. And all the forms assumed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the Book of the Dead by the deceased are well known forms of the
Sun-god.</p>

This has generally been

has shown that the  <img class="hiero" src="images/h973.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h974.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> ‘of the <em>East</em>’ is a synonym of <i>Māfkait</i>,
emerald, and M. Naville has referred to Pliny, who (<cite>Hist. Nat.</cite>,
XXXVII, 17) speaks of the Egyptian emeralds <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘qui eruuntur circa
Copton oppidum Thebaidis in collibus, ex cautibus.’</span> The same

Nepra is one of the names of Osiris, considered as giver of
corn, ὀ Πυροφόρος. By <em>Throat</em> is here meant the organ or power of
swallowing, deglutition.</p>

<em>Sacred Hawk.</em> Between this and the <em>Golden Hawk</em> of the
last chapter the vignettes make no distinction but that of colour,
which is indicative of age rather than of kind. The typical Egyptian
Hawk may be identified with the Falco Lanarius, or with the
Peregrinus, but naturalists tell us that “the Lanier of Buffon is the
perfect state of the male Peregrinus,” and that “the Lanner of
Pennant is a young female Peregrine.”</p>

Soul. The Egyptian word which in our modern languages
we translate as <em>Soul</em> has already been explained as meaning <em>Force</em>.
It is so translated in this chapter in several passages where this sense
is emphatically required.</p>

The Swallow <img class="hiero" src="images/h1008.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h190.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The objection to this meaning
is that the bird in question was eaten; and that doves or pigeons
would be less meagre food than the Swallow, and therefore more
probably intended in the Egyptian texts. But Swallows are still
eaten at Rome, where like Clive Newcome we may be regaled
not only with “wild swans and ducks” but with “robins, owls,
and οἰωνοῖσι τε πᾶσι for dinner.” And Willughby, the naturalist,
found a large quantity of swallows being sold for food at Valencia in
Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>The flat head, the short legs, and the tail of the bird are characteristic
not of the pigeon but of the swallow, and on many pictures
(<i>e.g.</i>, pl. xxi, vignette from Leyden papyrus) we are reminded of the
song--</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not quite plain why the name of Scorpion should be given

word Heart has dropped out of the later texts (<i>e.g.</i>, the Turin copy),
but in the older papyri it is found in the form of <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h090.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In Chapter 86 <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> has unquestionably the sense of <em>ascertaining
by inspection.</em> The Abbot Papyrus in its account of the
enquiry respecting the spoliation of the royal coffins gives ample
evidence of this meaning. And the word there used for <em>reporting</em>
the result of the inspection is, as is Ch. 86, <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h341.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h727.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>semȧu</i>, in
Coptic <span class='large'>ⲧⲁⲙⲉ</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is well to remember that <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> has another use; which
perhaps implies the existence of two homonymous roots. In a
passage quoted in <a href='#note64.21'>Note 21</a> to Ch. 64, it certainly signifies <em>restore</em>.
And this may possibly be its meaning in the rubric of Ch. 64. The
journey of Prince Hortâtâf may have had reference to the
<em>restoration</em>, not simply <em>inspection</em>, of the temples. In this sense it
is often written <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h881.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h405.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h881.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>sȧpu</i>.

<p class='c000'>Of this chapter we have unfortunately but one copy in <i>Fa</i>, of the
Musée Borély. This is defective both at the beginning and at the
end, and the text is inaccurate. The later copies are so inaccurate
that it is impossible to reconstitute the text. It is precisely on those
points where grammatical accuracy is required for fixing a definite
sense that the manuscripts are hopelessly defective. The preceding
translation is <em>verbally</em> correct, I trust, but I do not pretend that it is
intelligible. It stops where the papyrus <i>Fa</i> stops.</p>

It is not only in Egyptian that verbs of sight are applied to
other perceptions. Aeschylus says κτύπον δέδορκα in <cite>Sept. c. Th.</cite> 104,
and the Hebrew writers furnish similar examples.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note90.3'/><a href='#nref90.3'>3.</a>
<em>At the mouth of Osiris and the heart of Sutu.</em> To justify this
translation the same preposition ought to govern <em>mouth</em> and <em>heart</em>.
But I do not know any copy in which this occurs. The Turin reading
is simply absurd.</p>

I cannot agree with those who have hitherto translated this
chapter. The only grammatical interpretation which seems possible
for the first sentence depends upon the sense given to the suffix
<img class="hiero" src="images/h146.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>tȧ</i>. I take this as representing the second person singular.

translated by the vocative.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note92.2'/><a href='#nref92.2'>2.</a>
The words which follow are evidently the words of Osiris and
those attached to him, which are addressed to the deceased and are
repeated by him. The text here, as indeed everywhere, is very
corrupt.</p>

<p class='c000'>This chapter contains one of those threats (of which there are

But this word is written
in different ways in the papyri. With <img class="hiero" src="images/h099.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> as a suffix it would mean
‘my destroyer.’ <i>Ca</i> gives <img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> as a determinative, and thus creates a
god <i>Hetmu</i>, or at least a name punning upon that of Tmu, to which
it is united.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span><a id='note93.3'/><a href='#nref93.3'>3.</a>
The more recent texts, like those of the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>,
insert a negative particle before the mention of each disaster. They
pray that the Phallus of Rā may <em>not</em> be devoured, that the blindness

<p class='c000'>Chapters 96 and 97 are really but one chapter, which M. Naville
has found in only two MSS. of the early period. The end of what
Lepsius calls chapter 97 is hopelessly corrupt. On comparing the
three copies given by M. Naville (two of them being from the

<p class='c000'>There is but one papyrus of the older period which contains any
portion of this chapter, and it does so very imperfectly.</p>

<p class='c000'>On referring to M. Naville’s edition it will be seen that not only
the title but the greater part of the chapter is destroyed. The later
copies have texts so different from the original form, that it is unsafe
to attempt a restoration except within very strict limits.</p>

finishes sooner than they do. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>Teta</i>, l. 331.</p>

<i>Hat-ka-Ptah</i> is the name of Memphis, but as in so many

Bread and beer are not mentioned in the earliest text, which
has other important variants. The latest texts have the verb
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1091.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026h.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <em>wash</em>, <em>make clean</em>, <em>purify</em>, of which <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1092.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1093.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> on the
Berlin statue and the Theban papyri may fairly be considered an
older form. But Horhotep has <img class="hiero" src="images/h026i.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, a different word and
occurring in a grammatical construction differing from that of the
other texts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The words <img class="hiero" src="images/h518.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h664.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h776.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1094.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> occur as a familiar
formula in the Pyramid texts (Unas, 185, 205; Teta, 91); but
Horhotep interpolates <img class="hiero" src="images/h1074.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h013.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> after <img class="hiero" src="images/h026.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h776.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.

the copyist understood the word as meant for the sacrificial joint.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not uninteresting to note, with reference to the correctness
of the title of this chapter, that the Pyramid ritual (Unas, 205)
expressly says of the deceased that “the sacrificial joint with the

<p class='c000'>The chapters 108, 109, 112, 113, and 114 being so analogous to
each other, in form, matter, style, and composition, and each being
concerned with the divine <em>Powers</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1098.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> of some locality, it is interesting
to know that one at least of these chapters is found on a
monument of the Middle Empire. The others are probably not less
ancient, and the text published by Dr. Golenischef (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr. f.
Aegypt. Spr.</cite></span>, 1874, p. 84) from the Sarcophagus at St. Petersburg
already bears manifest signs of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another sign of antiquity as regards the present chapter may be
seen in the numerous forms in which it has come down to us.
These are so different, and sometimes so irreconcileable, that it
seems evident that tradition has handed down very corrupt texts,
and that the original meaning of this chapter had been entirely lost
at a very early date and cannot be discovered now. The oldest
text is the shortest of all, but it is both imperfect and incorrect.
The earliest papyri differ greatly from the later ones. But both the
earlier and the later papyri have the 149th chapter which contains
another recension of the 108th, and chapter 111 in the Turin and
later papyri is another form of it.</p>

Coptic <span class='large'>ⲃⲟⲩϩⲓ</span> ‘eyelids.’ In the later texts the word has for

The oldest text (which is here the best authority) does not give
the dimensions of the hill, but only of the serpent. The earliest
papyri give the dimensions of both, but make the hill so absurdly
small that the serpent could not rest upon it. Later papyri beginning
with <i>Pf</i> have corrected the texts so as to give the hill a length
of 300 cubits, or <img class="hiero" src="images/h1106.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /> (each of which is 100 cubits long). They omit
the statement that the cubit in question is of 7½ palms (the Royal
cubit being of 7 palms), and also the interesting mention of the
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1104.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h858.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1105.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> “balance (or measurement) of the earth.” The
relation of this ‘balance’ to the rest of the sentence is not clear,
because the MSS. differ as to the preposition which precedes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Papyrus of Nebseni gives the hill 300 cubits in breadth.
The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span> of Turin reads 370 <img class="hiero" src="images/h1106.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /> in length, and 140 cubits
in breadth.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note108.4'/><a href='#nref108.4'>4.</a>
The serpent’s name is not mentioned in chapter 111, nor is it
in the earliest text. But in chapter 149 the usual name is
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1108.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h709.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, more fully written <img class="hiero" src="images/h1109.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1110.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> in the Papyrus of
Nebseni. The determinative <img class="hiero" src="images/h709.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> commonly attached to the
name of Âpepi, expresses the meaning ‘sword smitten,’ ‘shot
with swords,’ ξιφόκτονος. We might otherwise have understood the
term in the sense of ξιφοκτόνος, ‘slayer with swords.’ The Papyrus
of Sutimes <i>Pd</i> calls the serpent <img class="hiero" src="images/h1111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1112.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1113.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> ‘knife-wounded.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The proper name <img class="hiero" src="images/h045.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1114.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1115.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, also written <img class="hiero" src="images/h045.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1114.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1116.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
<i>Māṭes</i>, an epithet of Âpepi, or of Sutu, also means “pierced with
swords.” But the expression itself seems sometimes to be found
in the active sense, “piercing like a sword.”</p>

<em>Close of Day</em>, when daylight has come to ‘a <em>stand</em>’ <img class="hiero" src="images/h1117.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h084.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.
This is the reading of the papyri. The oldest reading is
<img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h377.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h378.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1118.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h048.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> ‘at the time of sunset.’</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note108.6'/><a href='#nref108.6'>6.</a>
The earliest text says nothing of this, though it mentions the
“prison of Sutech,” in a passage corresponding to what the papyri
include in the ‘Words of Power’ which follow. The Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>says that, “Sutu is put into his prison, and that a chain of steel
is put upon his neck.” Pictures of the serpent with the chain upon
him will be found in Bonomi, <cite>Sarcoph.</cite>, plates 10 and 11.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a> There
is an evident fusion in this chapter, in its later form at least, as in
chapter 39, of the personages of Sutu and Âpepi.</p>

<em>Thy head is veiled.</em> The ‘veiling of the head,’ and ‘closing
of the eyes’ of the sun are of course mythological terms for night
time. But the mythological event was celebrated on the festival
called <img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h437.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h403.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1119.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note108.8'/><a href='#nref108.8'>8.</a>
Chapter 111 stops at the word “Sunset.” And after this, the
text in chapter 149 changes the third to the first person, and reads:
“But I go round the heaven whilst thou art pierced with hooks,” as
if Rā were replying to the words of Sutu. This, I confess, appears
to me to offer a better sense than that of chapter 108. And I
should now alter the word “stabber” in the first line of chapter 39
to “pierced with hooks.”</p>

and that the infant god is the calf to whom she gives birth. The
words “in presence of the god” are probably corrupt, but the
variants are apparently worse. The Morning Star was equally
identified with Horus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The later copies of the Book of the Dead add a few lines to the
chapter, of which they certainly formed no part when first written.
The most interesting portion of them is as follows:--</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are writings in thy possession for the grant of fields of
corn-land in which there sprouteth corn from the effluxes of the god
Ut’eb. The height of the corn is seven cubits, the ears of two
cubits; and thou shall reap it with the Glorified ones, in presence
of the Powers of the East. Thou shalt enter boldly at the mysterious
portals and be purified by those who are there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The name of the god hieroglyphically written <img class="hiero" src="images/h1130.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> was shown
by me (<cite>Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.</cite>, Vol. VI, p. 187) to be <i>Uteb</i> or <i>Ut’eb</i>.
Brugsch, apparently without having seen my note, came to the same
result, though he identified the god with Seb. The god is really
Osiris, and the text just quoted is illustrated by a picture of which
various copies are found. That here given is taken from the
temple of Philae.</p>

<p class='c000'>These pictures were known from the Ramesside period, but the

<em>Thou of corpselike form in Chait and Ânpit.</em> The sign of the
plural, here as elsewhere, is quite consistent with its application to a
single person. <img class="hiero" src="images/h1149.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1150.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>Chait</i> is the name<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a> of the 16th, or Mendesian,
Nome of Northern Egypt, and Ânpit was its metropolis. The
nome is mentioned in the inscription of Amten in the third dynasty.
The god is Osiris. He is invoked in the “Lamentations of Isis and
Nephthys,” and asked to come to Tattu, Ânpit and Chait, which are
but different names of one Sanctuary, <i>Cf.</i> Brugsch, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>, 1871,
p. 81, and his translation of the Mendesian Tablet, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>, 1875.</p>

This name corresponds
to the Greek Diktynna. The reason why a goddess representing
Heaven should be so called may be understood by the
Homeric epithet πολυωπόν applied to a net.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, however, the deity was <em>male</em>, according to the other reading,
the reference is τὸν τῆς Ἴσιδος τρόφιμον Δίκτυν, who was drowned
in the river. Plut., <cite>de Iside and Os.</cite>, 8.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and Greek contracts. The remainder of this invocation is so corrupt
that the sense cannot be safely guessed at.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note112.5'/><a href='#nref112.5'>5.</a>
See Herodotus, II, 47, without attaching too much importance
to details. The pig was certainly not considered impure (μιαρός) in
the days of the third or fourth dynasty, when Amten, who had risen
to the highest dignities, enumerates swine among the domestic
animals it is natural to possess. And impure animals were not
offered in sacrifice. But long before the days of Herodotus a change
had taken place in the Egyptian religion as to the nature of Sutu.</p>

<p class='c000'>Plutarch and Aelian are to be read with the like caution. Some
of their information is correct, but it is mixed up with much error.</p>

of animal for human sacrifice is (I believe) <em>entirely</em> without foundation.

The four <em>children</em> of Horus were also his <em>brothers</em>. He asks

Upper Egypt, and was called by the Greeks Hieracōnpolis, ‘city of

Between these words and those which the three old papyri<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a>
<i>Aa</i>, <i>Ae</i>, and <i>Ib</i>, which unfortunately do not agree together on all
points, have a few passages here which do not appear in the later
papyri. They read, “Horus and what his mother did, tossing in
distressful agitation <span class='xlarge'>(</span><img class="hiero" src="images/h473.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h474.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <span class='large'>ⲕⲓⲙ</span>, σαλεύεσθαι) over the

in words of which the sense is not clear; and Rā speaks words of
which the only certain ones are “the son of Isis.” Then follows
the usual text.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span><a id='note113.3'/><a href='#nref113.3'>3.</a>
This legend of Nechen is connected with that of the dismemberment
of Horus (τὸ περὶ τὸν Ὥρου διαμελισμὸν), of which we
have but very scanty information.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a> It must have been like a repetition
of what had happened to his father Osiris. The limbs of
Horus had been thrown into the water, and when Sebak threw his

<p class='c000'>There are two chapters (114 and 116) of “the Powers of Hermopolis,”
and they have been preserved separately both in the older
and in the more recent papyri. They are very similar in thought
but differently worded, and each throws a certain light upon the
other, without however dispelling the obscurity of this very ancient
religious composition. Some farther help, however insufficient, is
afforded by the pictures of the Book which records the passage of
the Sun-god through the twelve hours of the night.</p>

cases it acquires the sense of <em>being borne</em>, or <em>conveyed</em>, and is written
<img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1164.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1170.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> in Ptolemaic inscriptions. The corresponding word in
chapter 116 is <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1167.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1168.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which has the same meanings. One
of the pictures above alluded to (Lefébure, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Hypogées, Tombeau de
Seti</cite></span>, part IV, pl. 31) represents a boat carrying the Moon-disk,
raised upon a stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>A personage kneeling behind is supporting the feather of Maāt.

in a geographical sense, as when we speak of an ‘arm of the sea’.

<p class='c000'>The ancient text of this chapter has most unfortunately been
lost. A few words only remain in the fragments of Papyrus <i>Pm</i>.
M. Naville has also published what is found on an ostracon of the
time of the XVIIIth dynasty. There is no doubt that the form
of the text which has been handed down in the later papyri has
suffered great alterations. And a comparison between the Turin
and Cadet papyri shows in how untrustworthy a way this later form
of the text has been transmitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Special attention has been given to this chapter by Mr. Goodwin
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>, 1873, p. 104), and by M. Lefébure (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mélanges D’Arch.</cite></span>,
1874, p. 155), whose work is very much more valuable than that of
his English colleague. But the most important study bearing on
the relations between the older and the more recent recension is
that of M. Naville, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Un ostrakon égyptien,’</span> in the first volume of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Annales du Musée Guimet</cite></span>.</p>

Both terms are divine names; the latter corresponding to the Greek

<p class='c000'>The text of this chapter handed down by the Turin papyrus
and those which agree with it contains nothing very difficult for a
translator, but on being compared with the older copies it is found
to consist of a collection of small fragments of the older text put
together without any regard to their original order or context. And
about three-quarters of the old chapter are suppressed in the new
recension.</p>

<p class='c000'>The editors of the fine papyrus of Sutimes in their notes upon
this chapter remark, that in the Turin text the sentences are in quite
a different order from that of their papyrus, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“On peut y voir,”</span> they
say, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“l’effet de lectures et de transcriptions en rebours du sens, par
des scribes ayant mal compris les éditions en colonnes rétrogrades.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>This is, curiously enough, the very fault of the papyrus of
Sutimes itself, which is here wrong from beginning to end,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a> though
probably derived from an excellent original. It begins with the
“Isle of Corn and Barley,” and jumbles together quite incoherent
sentences.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oldest copy of the chapter yet discovered is that of the
Tomb of Chā-em-hait, at Thebes, and by a strange fatality it has
been published in such a form that in order to read it correctly, we
must begin with what is printed as line 11 and finish with line 1.
We have it also in a very incomplete condition. We miss the first
eighteen lines contained in the papyrus of Nebseni and the last
words of every line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The papyrus of Nebseni is the only complete text we have, and
here as well as elsewhere it is extremely incorrect. Some parts are
so corrupt that a translation must necessarily be dependent upon
conjectural emendations which can have no genuine claim upon
the reader’s confidence. We must be content with waiting till
better authorities are discovered.</p>

is given to Hathor in the temple of Dendera. The name of Ḥotep
(with different determinatives<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a>) belongs to one of the islands of this
blissful place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pyramid Texts furnish some interesting information not contained
in the Book of the Dead. We are told that the approach to
the Garden is over the Lake of Putrata (see chapter 40, <a href='#note40.1'>note 1</a>),
that there is a great lake (? that of Konsit) in the middle of the
Garden of Ḥotepit, upon which the great gods alight, and that the
<i>Achmiu Sekiu</i>, the starry deities who never set, there feed the
departed from the <em>wood of life</em> <span class='xlarge'>(</span><img class="hiero" src="images/h1012.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h029.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h030.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lignum vitæ</i></span><span class='xlarge'>)</span> “upon
which they themselves live, in order that he too may live.” Shu
and Tefnut are mentioned as divinities of this place. But perhaps
the most remarkable fact is that Horus had enemies even here, who,
however, were annihilated by the divine weapons at the disposal of
the departed worthy, who was led there in order that “he might sit
among the stars in heaven.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And here it was that the beatified personage sat upon his throne

submissive attitude, and made offerings to him. It was, perhaps,
from these offerings that the Garden derived its name.</p>

<em>Rise in Hotepit</em>, or (later on) <i>Hotep</i>, <img class="hiero" src="images/h274.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1189.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1217.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is
the name of one of the localities. The word <img class="hiero" src="images/h277.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /> as I have often
said, has the sense of <em>rising up</em>, <em>coming to light</em>, <em>making an appearance</em>,
and like the Greek φαίνομαι is especially applicable to the appearance
of daybreak, or the rise of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<em>Turning</em>, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1218.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The group has the apparent sense of
<em>building</em>, but the primitive sense is <em>turning</em>, as in the making of
pottery. The preposition <img class="hiero" src="images/h006.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which follows it in this place seems
to show that building is not meant.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note110.3'/><a href='#nref110.3'>3.</a>
This, of course, sounds like nonsense, but so does the original
as it has come down to us. The papyrus of Ani, which reads
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1219.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h084.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, forces the sense of <em>day</em> upon the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h407.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which in the
sense of <em>turn</em> would have been far more intelligible. There was the
‘Portion of Sutu,’ and the ‘Portion of Horus,’ each being half
the world, topographically, or half the twenty-four hours as regards
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suspect that ‘day’ is a faulty interpretation of the ambiguous
<img class="hiero" src="images/h407.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and that the true sense of the passage is that Sutu is satisfied
with the share which comes to his turn, and thereupon delivers
Horus from imprisonment in the lower world. The perplexity, or
ignorance of the copyists is seen in the very next words. One has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>‘he who is in Merit,’ others ‘he who is in my mouth,’ and two
‘he who is in the egg,’ if this be the sense of the very questionable

<em>Let my arteries be made fast, and let me have the enjoyment of
the Breeze</em>, or <em>that I may have enjoyment</em>. The oldest meaning of the
word <em>artery</em>, ἀρτηρία, in Hippocrates, Aristotle and the earlier Latin
writers is <em>wind-pipe</em>, and, in the plural, <em>air-ducts</em>. But, even when
the word was also applied to what we call arteries, these were
supposed to convey <em>air</em> whilst the veins conveyed <em>blood</em>. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sanguis
per venas in omne corpus diffunditur et spiritus per arterias”</span> is the
classic doctrine in Cicero (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Natura Deorum</cite></span>, 2, 55). Pliny says
(<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, XI, 89), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“arteriae carent sensu: nam et sanguine.”</span> This
error is corrected by Galen, who has a treatise on the question
“Whether Blood is <em>naturally</em> (κὰτα φύσιν) contained in the arteries?”
The error of the ancients arose from the arteries always being found
empty after death. The blood flowing from a wound inflicted
upon them was inferred to have been intruded into them by the
rupture of the veins. The Egyptian doctrine of the ‘arteries’

which air is conveyed to all parts of the person, was first found by

as suckling her son Horus (see picture in Lanzone, p. 844),
and it is this which characterizes her and from which she derives
her name. She is asked on the Louvre tablet (c. 14) for “the
white liquor which the glorified ones love.” This is distinctly called
‘milk’ on the Florentine tablet 2567, and vases of her milk are
mentioned (Dümichen, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Resultate</cite></span>, 27, 6) in the inscriptions of
Dendera. A picture of her given in Dümichen’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Historische
Inschriften</cite></span> (II, 32) identifies her with Hathor, and calls her “divine
mother, mistress of heaven and sovereign of the gods,” while others
call her “the divine mother and fair nurse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There can be no doubt about the right reading of the name

of <i>ḥetemit</i>. We must therefore attach no importance to this latter
name when applied in the vignette of the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span> to one
of the divine abodes which bears the name of the goddess, and is

is but one of the contradictory readings. It has, however, the

that of a goddess mentioned in connection with the next abode.

This chapter and the following have reference to Restau, one
of the Gates between the Netherworld and Heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not mentioned in the most ancient recension of chapter 17
(from which my translation was taken), but in all the papyri of the
eighteenth and later dynasties it is stated that Restau was a gate
south of An-aaref and north of the “Domain (<img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1268.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />) of
Osiris.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The papyrus of Ani has this picture of it,</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i204.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<p class='c022'>but the most interesting representations of it are in the Dublin
papyrus (<i>D. a</i>), where the Sun god is seen passing between the
folding doors, and in the papyrus of Hunefer (<i>A. g</i>), where the
doors are also open and the god is sitting between them. (<i>See</i>
Plates VI, 11 and VIIb.)</p>

are the passages guarded by the faithful attendants of Osiris, but
armed with “hurtful fingers” against the adversaries of Rā, against
whose onslaught the deceased prays Rā for protection in chapter 17.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mystical interpretation will be found in chapter 119 and note.</p>

that he may be girt by the goddess Tait. A passage in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todt.</cite></span> 78, 26
(Turin text) would be of greater interest were it not an emendation

The throne of Osiris in pictures of the Psychostasia (<i>see</i>
Vignettes to Chapter 125) rests upon water, out of which there
springs a lotus flower; and upon this flower stand the four children
of Horus. In a passage of chapter 147, which is an adaptation of the

to signify uncle. It occurs on funereal monuments among the designations
of persons connected with the deceased, such as brother,
sister, nurse. A man may have several bearing the designation, and
they are not necessarily children of the same parents (<i>see e.g.</i>, Mariette,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Cat. d’Abydos</cite></span>, p. 110, where a man has five <i>chenemesu</i>, who cannot
all be brothers either of his father or his mother). The word occurs
repeatedly in the Prisse papyrus. I am inclined to think it means
the legal guardian of a minor.</p>

This chapter (which is repeated in Chapter 139) is like the
repetition of an important passage in Chapter 110. But the
differences are very considerable, and it is for criticism to decide
the question of priority between the two recensions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whichever be the earlier recension, the present one is of very great
interest and importance. It is found on two of the most carefully
written papyri of the eighteenth dynasty. But the most interesting
feature is the mythological allusion at this date (<em>at latest</em>) to an
astronomical phenomenon, with reference to which later researches
may furnish fresh evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker in this chapter is said (not merely implied, as in
Chapter 110, <i>see</i> <a href='#note110.5'>note 5</a>) to be Thoth, who is the measurer of all
things in heaven and earth, and the author and regulator of all
science. He is here said to have established the <em>equilibrium</em>
<img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h542.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1306.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> between the Divine Pair, Horus and Sutu; that is
Day and Night. Such an equilibrium, strictly speaking, never exists
except at the <em>Equinoxes</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the most important passage is, “I have rescued the <i>Âtu</i>
from his backward course.” The <img class="hiero" src="images/h1307.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1303.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <i>Âtu</i> is a mythological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span><em>fish</em>, who is represented as following the course of the Bark
of Rā. The meaning of the name is, <em>the Cleaver</em>, <em>Divider</em>, <em>Cutter
in two</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1309.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026f.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. It is one of the appellatives of the Sun-god,
with reference to his path through the sky. But what is that solar
phenomenon specially deserving to be characterised by its <em>motion
backwards</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h997.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1310.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />?</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not think any astronomer would hesitate to answer, that
<em>Precession</em> is meant. The cause of Precession could only be known
to really scientific philosophers (which is out of question in this
case), but the <em>phenomena</em> would necessarily be noted by those
who had important interests in keeping their calendar correct.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
Even the Chinese, by dint of records and without any mathematics,
came to infer the precession of the equinoxes; so did the Egyptians
apparently at a very much earlier period; and Hipparchus, who has
the credit of the discovery, may have learnt it from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although <img class="hiero" src="images/h1307.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1303.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is commonly represented as a <em>fish</em>, the
same name is given to a <em>Crustacean</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1312.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1313.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> whose organs of
locomotion are specially adapted for backward motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Rescuing</em> the Âtu from its backward course” can mean nothing
less than being able to <em>correct</em> or (in technical language) to <em>equate</em>
the phenomena.</p>

<p class='c000'>It might perhaps be suggested that the backward course here
spoken of has reference to the year of 360 days, corrected at an
early period by the addition of the five supplementary days. This
would certainly have been a very probable explanation of the clause,
but for the direct connection which this has with what precedes,
concerning the equilibrium between Day and Night; that is, the
Equinox.</p>

the subject. If there were “ladies of the royal antechamber,” it
by no means follows that they were wives or concubines of the
king, and hall or antechamber convey a very different idea from
that of the most reserved portion of the house.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Pictures and inscriptions on mummy cases identify the term

<em>The arms which announce Glory for me.</em> The clue to the

form implying an antecedent, which can only be “the arms.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>The <em>arms which announce Glory for me</em> are to be explained by
the usages of the ancient ritual, which prescribed certain postures

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For the significance of this most important chapter with reference
to the religion and ethics of ancient Egypt I must refer to the Introduction.
The notes in this place must be confined to the text and
its elucidation.</p>

<p class='c000'>No copy of the chapter is known of more ancient date than the
eighteenth dynasty, but the oldest papyri contain the three parts of
which the chapter consists. That the chapter is of much earlier
date than the eighteenth dynasty is quite certain from the nature of
the corruptions which had already made their appearance in the
earliest copies which have come down to us. But the three parts
are not necessarily of the same antiquity. The second part seems
to have grown out of the first and to have been suggested by the
mention of the “Forty-two” gods and the “negative confession,” as
it is called, of certain sins. It is a tabulated form in which the gods
are named and a sin is mentioned in connection with each god.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The number of sins in this form is therefore forty-two; a higher
number than in Part I.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two catalogues agree to a certain extent, but they also
disagree, and the second is evidently the result of a different process
of thought than that which gave birth to the first. The author of
Part I is not the author of Part II, unless perhaps at a different and
later period. Nor is there any indication in Part I of the extraordinary
examination to which the deceased person is subjected in
Part III. This in itself would not be a serious objection, but the
matter becomes more complicated if we remember that the picture
of the Psychostasia has the right to be considered as a part of the
chapter. The texts which are written upon it differ, indeed,
according to the taste of the artist, and can therefore claim no
canonical authority. But the question as to the order of succession
in the trials, or the precise moment at which the deceased person is
finally freed from all anxiety as to his fate, cannot be satisfactorily
solved on the supposition that all these documents form parts of a
consistent whole. It seems much more natural to consider them as
really independent compositions brought together in consequence of
their subject matter. The artists of the Ramseside period (in the
papyri of Hunefer and Ani) add another scene<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a> in which the
deceased is judged not by the forty-two assessors of Osiris but by a
smaller company of gods (twelve or fourteen), sitting on thrones and
bearing the names of well known divinities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The essential notion was that of a trial before Osiris, in which the
man’s conduct or conscience was weighed in the Balance. This trial
is referred to in various chapters of the Book of the Dead and in
other texts which prove that, with reference to the details, free scope
was allowed to the imagination of the scribes or artists.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of the Forty-two assessors might be thought connected
with that of the Nomes of Egypt. But this number is only
certain for the later periods of Egyptian history, and is not true for
earlier times. Moreover the localities in which the gods are said to
make their appearances do not correspond to the nomes, or places
within them. Some of the localities occur more than once, and
some of them, if not all, are localities not upon earth. Heaven
occurs twice, the eleventh god makes his appearance at Amenta and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the forty-second in the Netherworld. But the names which have a
more earthly sound may have a mystical meaning. The first god
makes his appearance in Annu, so does the seventeenth and so does
the twenty-fourth. But does this mean Heliopolis of Egypt? On
referring to an important text in Mariette’s <cite>Monuments Divers</cite>,
pl. 46, it will be seen that Annu is the Eastern <em>Solar Mountain</em>

of the East. There cannot be a more striking illustration of “the
Divine Babe who maketh his appearance in Annu” (the twenty-fourth
Assessor), than the <em>picture</em> I refer to.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The same considerations apply to such names as those of
Sutenhunen and Tattu.</p>

<p class='c000'>The presence of the divine “Babe,” of the god “of long strides”
(Rā), of the god “of Lion form,” of the goddess Bast, of Nefer-tmu,
of the “Striker” (<i>Ahi</i>, a name of Horus), and of Nehebkau,
not to mention others, among the Assessors, would of itself be
sufficient to convince us that, in spite of the strange and terrific
names of some of these personages, they are not to be looked upon
as fiends, like Malacoda, Scarmiglione, and the rest of the demon
crew in the Inferno of Dante. They are not evil spirits, but gods,
all of them, “subsisting on righteousness;” there is “nothing <em>wrong</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>about them.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a> They are the gods who accompany Osiris, and,
according to Egyptian theology, are his Names, his Limbs, his
Body. If the names of some of them appear harsh or cruel, it is
because strict Justice is inexorable, and Mercy is a quality never
thought of in Egyptian theology.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exact notion of Maāt in Egyptian texts is discussed in
another part of the present work. In this chapter I have translated
it <em>Righteousness</em>, because the question here is about <em>moral conduct</em>:
and conformity to the strict Rule of Right towards one’s fellow
men, one’s own self and the heavenly powers is what is meant by
Righteousness. And here it is opposed to moral transgression or
sin, not to physical evil, which itself is a very frequent result from
the operation of the inexorable Maāt.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in the expression,  “Hall of Righteousness,” the word in
Egyptian is used in the dual number: hence the erroneous or
inadequate translations, “the Two Truths,” or “Double Justice,”
and the guesses which have been made as to their meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very important determinative of the Egyptian word is found
not only in the papyri but in the very earliest mention yet known
of the Hall. The great inscription of the tomb of Peher at El Kab,
calls it the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1345.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h469.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h065.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1346.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1347.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The repetition of the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h020.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> indicates
a locality in which the Sun-god is <em>present</em>, as in the cases of
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1348.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1349.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1350.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1351.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and many others. Space is divided into two
parts; one on the Southern and one on the Northern side of the
god as he proceeds on his course. And when we have for determinatives
two Uræi <img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, or two ostrich Feathers <img class="hiero" src="images/h280.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h280.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>have to understand two goddesses Maāt, one to the Left and one <a id='corr224.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to to'>to</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_224.2'><ins class='correction' title='to to'>to</ins></a></span>
the Right side of Osiris.</p>

<p class='c000'>These goddesses are Isis and Nephthys, who play very conspicuous
parts in a symbolism discussed in note 2 of the present
chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be well if evidence could be brought with equal facility
to bear upon all the difficulties with which the chapter abounds.
But though a very lively interest was attracted to it ever since
Champollion quoted extracts from it in his Grammar, the difficulties
with which he did not attempt to cope have only increased with our
knowledge of the language and its scientific treatment. The text is
extremely doubtful in many important parts, the forty-two sins are
not the same in all the manuscripts, and they are not assigned to
the jurisdiction of the same gods. So important a papyrus as that
of Sutimes omits some sins of which an Egyptian would certainly be
expected to give an account. The same word is made to appear
with different meanings in the same passage of the papyri when they
are compared together. And there are not a few important words
of which the meaning was first only guessed at by the first translators,
but has been retained without sufficient warrant by their successors.
The present translation is presented under the full consciousness of
all its imperfections, and of the difficulties which have yet to be
overcome before a version can be called satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very admirable contribution towards our acquaintance with
the first part of the chapter was made as far back as 1866 by Dr.
Pleyte in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Etudes Egyptologiques</cite></span>. Since then other versions have
appeared by MM. Devéria, Lefébure and Pierret.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Demotic text of the chapter, first published by Brugsch, and
now more recently, with a complete translation, by M. Revillout, is
in itself most interesting, but written, as it is, in the days of imperial
Rome, cannot always be appealed to as to an authoritative exposition
of the ancient text.</p>

This title of Osiris is made clear by the 37th
chapter, which begins with an invocation to the <em>Sister Pair of
Goddesses, Merta</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h055.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1359.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h151.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1359.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h036.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <i>Merta</i> signifying
<em>Two Eyes</em>, and the divine Sister pair being Isis and Nephthys.</p>

<p class='c000'>In vignettes of the chapter (see, <i>e.g.</i>, Pl. XXXIII and XXXIV,
figs. 14 and 16 for instances) the two goddesses appear in human
form with their brother Osiris within the naos where the judgment
is delivered. It is not so easy to recognise them under the form
<img class="hiero" src="images/h878a.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h878b.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which they have in the vignette of <i>Pb.</i> (see Pl. XXXI),
or in the picture which is found in many papyri (<i>e.g.</i>, those of
Nebseni, Hunefer, Ani and the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>), wherein the
cornice or top row of the decoration surmounting the forty-two
judges has for central figure a man (Osiris) either supporting the
Two Eyes or extending his hands above them (see Pl. XXXIV,
fig. 14).</p>

<p class='c000'>We have here a symbolism of such extreme importance as to
justify a short excursus on the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Two Eyes <img class="hiero" src="images/h878a.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h878b.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> are a most frequent symbol on all
funereal monuments; on the most ancient coffins, such as those of
Apaānchu, Antuf, Taka (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Denkm.</cite></span>, II, 98, 146, 147), Mentuhotep
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Aelteste Texte</cite></span>, pl. 9 and 25), Sebak-āa (Gio. d’Athanasi, pl. 3) and
Amamu, as on mummy cases generally, and on funereal tablets.
Between the Eyes on many tablets we frequently find the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h1361.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
and this is often followed by the sign of Water <img class="hiero" src="images/h096.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or the Vase <img class="hiero" src="images/h1226.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
and very frequently by both. Very often we have two signs <img class="hiero" src="images/h1361.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, one
by each Eye, and not less frequently a pair of jackals, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1362.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h1363.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
facing each other. No two tablets are exactly alike, but the
meaning is always the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is the meaning changed when the tablet is headed by the
Winged Disk <img class="hiero" src="images/h1364.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h1365.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> even though the Eyes are not seen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Their place is supplied by two Uræi, sometimes crowned with the
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1366.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and the <img class="hiero" src="images/h069.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, insignia of Southern and Northern sovereignty.</p>

<p class='c000'>On a fine tablet of the twelfth dynasty (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Denkm.</cite></span>, II, 136<i>b</i>), the
sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h1361.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is attached to each Uræus, and this device is repeated on
innumerable monuments.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to another device the Two Eyes are represented
within the Winged Disk (see <i>e.g.</i>, Leemans, <cite>Mon.</cite>, III, <i>M.</i>, Pl. XVI).</p>

<p class='c000'>“He of the Pair of Eyes” is always Osiris. But Osiris is a god
“of many names,” as the Pyramid Texts show no less than the
Book of the Dead, where in the seventeenth chapter he is identified
with Tmu, Rā, the Bennu, Amsu and Horus, not to mention others,
and where in the Scholia the Two Feathers, the Two Uræi, the Two
Eyes and the Two Kites<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a> are identified with the Sister pair Isis and
Nephthys. And wherever these symbols occur in <em>pairs</em> Isis and
Nephthys are meant, one for the right or northern side and the other
for the left or southern. The same idea is conveyed under such forms
as <img class="hiero" src="images/h1367.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1368.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, or <img class="hiero" src="images/h1369.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and many others. Dr. Birch long ago
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>, 1877, p. 33) mentioned <img class="hiero" src="images/h1370.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h270.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1370.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> as representing Osiris
between his two sisters. Osiris is often represented as a living <img class="hiero" src="images/h270.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
with eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The royal crowns and their decorations, such as <img class="hiero" src="images/h1373.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1374.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1375.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1371.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and <img class="hiero" src="images/h1372.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
abound in this symbolism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient coffin of Sebakāa at Berlin (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Aelteste Texte</cite></span>, pl. 29), in
the phrase <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1376.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1154.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h134.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h878b.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h553.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, recognizes Isis as one of the Two
Eyes. Down to the latest periods the Sisters were known as
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1377.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1054.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1378.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <em>Eye of the Southern</em> or Left <em>side</em> (Isis), and <img class="hiero" src="images/h1377.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1054.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h639.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
<em>Eye of the Northern</em> or Right <em>side</em> (Nephthys). On countless coffins
and sarcophagi these goddesses are represented on opposite sides,
in kneeling attitude, holding the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1361.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> in their hands, like the equivalent
Vultures of the North and South, with their claws, and the
Uræi on their bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The meaning of the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h1361.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is well known. It is a <em>ring</em>, and
is applied to the circuit of the heavens made by the sun and other
heavenly bodies. It is also applied to the yearly recurring flow of
the Nile. It has numerically the signification of 10,000,000 or an
indefinitely large number. As attached, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1381.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, to the sign of years <img class="hiero" src="images/h378.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,<img class="hiero" src="images/h1382.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />

<p class='c000'>The sign of <em>Water</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h096.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and the <em>Vase</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1226.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, are also emblems of
Osiris, one of whose names is <em>Water of Renewal</em>. A chapter of the
Pyramid Texts, Teta, 176, Pepi I, 518, which begins by saying that
Seb has given to the departed (identified with Osiris) the Two Eyes
of <em>that Great One</em>,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a> and has done that through Horus who recognizes
his father, proceeds after this to say: “He renews thee in thy name

<p class='c000'>I cannot say if the <em>Vase</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1226.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is a mere appendage to the
<em>Water</em>, but if it is not it most probably was meant to contain the
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1384.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, the divine and life-giving <em>Sap</em> flowing from Osiris, which is
mentioned in another Pyramid Text (Pepi I, 33), also speaking of
the <em>Water of Renewal</em>, as a name of Osiris.</p>

<p class='c000'>The goddesses Isis and Nephthys as mythological figures
represent not merely the Light at Dawn and Sunset, but the Light

The frequent
expression <img class="hiero" src="images/h1390.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h878b.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> means <em>full moon</em>, and is constantly
identified with the fifteenth day of the month <img class="hiero" src="images/h1391.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The moon is
in these texts called the <em>Left Eye</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h230.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1392.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and Osiris is said to unite

seen on certain tablets.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what is the meaning of the passage at the end of Part I of
this chapter--“when the Eye is full in Annu, on the last day of
Mechir” <img class="hiero" src="images/h554.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h2004.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h2005.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h2006.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, an expression which is repeated in
the title of Chapter 140? The moon, which is always represented
as full on the fifteenth of the month, cannot be full on the thirtieth.
It must be the other Eye, the Sun. Now we know what is meant
by the Full Moon, the Plenilunium, but what is the Full Sun?</p>

<p class='c000'>M. de Rougé, in his commentary on the 17th Chapter, gave the
key to this, by pointing out that the 30th Mechir was the last day
of the sixth month of the year; that is the 180th day after the first
of Thoth, which is supposed to coincide with the Summer Solstice.
It is therefore at the time of the <em>Winter</em> Solstice that the Eye is
said to be full. The inaccuracy, of course, arises from the length
of the Egyptian year. But there can be no doubt that the time
of the Winter Solstice is meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1470 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> the Egyptian year began on July 20, and
the 30th Mechir coincided with January 15 of the Julian calendar.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Eye (considered as the Sun) is said to be <em>full</em> at the
Winter Solstice, it was most probably spoken of in the same way
not only at the Summer Solstice, but also at the two Equinoxes.
And this is the most probable reason why in the pictures representing
the Four Rudders of Heaven (North, South, East and West)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>an Eye <img class="hiero" src="images/h878b.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is attached to each rudder. (See Vignettes of
Chapter 148.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The Two Eyes, considered as Sun and Moon, are attributed not
only to Rā and Osiris, but to gods identified with these. Of the
two passages which have been most frequently quoted, “Thy
Right Eye is the Sun <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1396.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and thy left is the Moon <img class="hiero" src="images/h1397.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,”
“His Right Eye is the Sun and his left is the Moon,” the first is
addressed to Ptah (in the Pap. Berlin, VII, l. 42), and the second,
which occurs on the Neapolitan Stele, is really addressed to Osiris
as god of Suten-hunen, under the form of the Ram-headed deity
Her-śefit. Reference is made towards the end of the inscription to
the “divine Eyes which are in Suten-hunen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Horus according to the Pyramid Texts has two eyes, a Light
one and a Dark one. But the “Eye of Horus” is most frequently
spoken of in the singular number. It is certainly meant for the Sun,
and the name of it is given to cakes and ale, wine, corn, oil, honey,
and all the good things which come to maturity through the beneficent
god: who has in himself all the attributes of ‘Ceres and
Bacchus.’</p>

<p class='c000'>I must bring this long note to an end with one or two observations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many goddesses will be found bearing the title of Eye of Rā.
There is not one of these who is not identified with Isis or Nephthys,
who are in fact one, and personify the Light of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shu and Tefnut, who are brother and sister, play the same parts
as the two goddesses.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a picture, which appears in the vignette of Chapter 17
in most of the papyri of the second and later periods, of two <em>male</em>
deities bearing the Eyes over their heads (see Pl. <a href='#pl35'>XXXV</a>). If the
beards upon their chins are not a mistake,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a> copied from one
papyrus upon another, they must represent not Isis and Nephthys
but the two Rehu <img class="hiero" src="images/h055.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> Rā and Thoth, Sun and Moon,
instead of the <img class="hiero" src="images/h055.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1398.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero-b" src="images/h1399.jpg" height="36" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero-b" src="images/h1400.jpg" height="36" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is important to note that if Sun and Moon are Eyes of Osiris
or Rā or Ptah, the deity is not to be confounded with them: they
are but manifestations of himself.</p>

The sign of plurality does not
here, any more than in Chapter 1, necessarily imply more than one
person. The crime in question is one to which men are easily
tempted in certain stages of society. Abimelech, in the book of
Judges (ix, 5), “slew his brethren, the sons of Jerubbaal.” Jephthah
had to “flee from the face of his brethren.” Absalom had his
brother Amnon <a id='corr230.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='assasinated'>assassinated</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_230.7'><ins class='correction' title='assasinated'>assassinated</ins></a></span>, and all the king’s sons fled in fear of
sharing the same fate. Solomon put to death his elder brother
Adonijah. Athaliah, the queen mother, “destroyed all the seed
royal” of Judah. The annals of eastern<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and even western<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a> nations
are full of such occurrences. But, in positions less exalted than
that of claimants to royalty, ambition or covetousness are motives
to crimes like that of the wicked uncle of ‘the Babes in the Wood.’<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a>

of <em>smallness</em>, seems to indicate that the victims of the crime are
<em>minors</em>, perhaps <em>wards</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the papyri (even that of Nebseni) have a <em>calf</em>, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1403.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
as determinative of the word, and as the ‘slaying of calves’ is not
necessarily a crime, other scribes have added <img class="hiero" src="images/h097.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1404.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, ‘sacred,’ and
thus made the sin one of sacrilege.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same word, like the Greek μόσχος and the Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pullus</i></span>,
might be applied to the young of all kinds of animals; but the
Egyptian scribes have in such cases a propensity to use a determinative
which forces a wrong sense upon the word.</p>

<p class='c000'>The balance is so frequently represented in false perspective by
Egyptian artists, that Sir J. G. Wilkinson has given an account of it,
which is quite unintelligible to those who have ever so moderate
a knowledge of statics. Mr. Petrie’s description is the true one.
“The beam was suspended by a loop or ring from a bracket projecting
from the stand.... Then below the beam, a long tongue
was attached, not above the beam as with us. To test the level
of the beam, a plummet hung down the tongue, and it was this
plummet which was observed to see if the tongue was vertical and
the beam horizontal.”--<cite>A Season in Egypt</cite>, p. 42.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Pl. XXXVI, a few pictures will be found which give a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>correct notion of the Egyptian balance than some of the absurd
representations which defy a scientific explanation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident that if the tongue is fastened at a wrong angle, the beam
will not really be horizontal when the tongue is shown by the plummet
line to be vertical. This seems to be the fraud alluded to in the text.</p>

“He turned not a deaf ear to the

deictic, it is susceptible of very many shades of meaning, and it

The following examples are only intended to illustrate its <em>grammatical</em>
use in our text.</p>

<p class='c000'>The particle occurs three times before as many propositions at

Thoth.’ It is as if the speaker said, ‘<em>It is in consequence of</em> my being
Thoth, that I have balanced,’ <i>etc.</i></p>

confined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The seventy-five Forms in question (each of which is a god) are,
as the text itself shows, simply so many names of the Solar god
or solar phenomena. Each of them is addressed as <img class="hiero" src="images/h084.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h103.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h104.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h037.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
‘Rā, supreme of power,’ after which some attribute of the deity
is mentioned, and the name of the deity is connected with this
attribute.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Greece, Apollo was called ἑκηβόλος, καταιβάσιος, ἀποτροπαῖος,
νεομήνιος, and by ever so many other names expressive of the
attributes with which he was credited. These names correspond to
what Egyptian mythology called the <img class="hiero" src="images/h226.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h388.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> of a god, and each
of the names has but a limited application. The god is not always
thought of as ‘Far-darting’; under the conception of ‘Neomenios,’
he <em>dwells</em> in what Egyptian mythology called another
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1623.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h353.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which is the local habitation, or, as mathematicians would
say, the <em>locus</em> of the concept.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. de Rougé, without giving any reason, but probably guided
by what Champollion had written, translates the word <em>zone</em>.
M. Naville, who has carefully studied the word, prefers <em>sphere</em>. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>no better word could be thought of, if we used it as we do in
speaking of ‘moving in a certain sphere,’ ‘each in his own sphere,’
or, ‘the sphere of action;’ without applying a strict geometrical sense
to the word. For the Egyptian <img class="hiero" src="images/h1623.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h243.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> was a hollow cylinder like
a round tower, a chimney, or a deep well rather than a sphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the explanation I have just given, I prefer <em>Bounds</em> as a
more expressive translation. The word appears in the dual form
on account of the presence of the god.</p>

Nile, supposed to be in the neighbourhood of Elephantine. The
inscription of Seti I at Redesieh (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Denkm.</cite></span>, III, 140B) compares
the abundance of water at the King’s cistern to that of the

It has been supposed that the Coptic <span class='large'>ⲕⲟⲣ</span>ⲓ <em>cataracts</em> might be

This passage as it stands is the alteration of one of the

Its chief value in this place is in evidence of a truth not yet

in the Pyramid Texts, <i>Up-uat</i>) is really Osiris. The proofs are
numerous and overwhelming.</p>

and in 1891 Brugsch published in his <cite>Thesaurus</cite> (p. 1420) a tablet,
now in the Louvre, of the same period as the obelisk, which also
treats Ap-uat as one of the names of Osiris. But the earliest as well
as the most instructive evidence is that of the Pyramid Texts. The
later form of it is thus given on the coffin of <i>Nes-Shu-Tefnut</i> at
Vienna (see Bergman, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Recueil</cite></span>, VI, p. 165): “Horus openeth for
thee thy Two Eyes that thou mayest see with them in thy name of
Ap-uat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Pyramids of Teta (l. 281) and Pepi (l. 131) say, “Horus
openeth for thee thine Eye that thou mayest see with <em>it</em> in <em>its</em> name
<i>Ap-uat</i>.” Each of the Eyes of Osiris is Ap-uat, one of them is the
Southern and the other is the Northern Jackal. These two facing
each other form part of the symbolism explained in Note 2 upon
Chapter 125.</p>

<p class='c000'>The figure of the Jackal is wholly insufficient as an argument
that Ap-uat is identical with Anubis. Much better evidence is found
in the fact that the name of Anubis is sometimes written over the
figure.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a> But the true explanation of this is, what might have seemed
incredible to some of our older scholars, that Anubis is itself only
one of the names of Osiris.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>The Pyramids of Pepi I (line 474 and following) and Pepi II
(l. 1262 and following) give imaginary etymologies of certain names
of Osiris which are repeated in the inscriptions of the tomb of
Horhotep, published by M. Maspero (<cite>Miss. Arch.</cite>, I, 260). One of
these names is <img class="hiero" src="images/h1652.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h120.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which is said to be derived from <img class="hiero" src="images/h1658.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,

This title is given to the Chapter in the later recensions, and
nearly resembles that given in the Berlin papyrus of Nechtu-amen
(of the XIXth dynasty). That given in another papyrus of the older
period is quite different,--“<em>Chapter whereby the Chu is fortified</em>.”

in the title of another chapter. The <em>Sheniu</em> of this chapter are
living personages who attend upon the Osiris and greet him with
their acclamations. The word is often translated ‘princes,’ <a id='corr259.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘officers,'>‘officers,’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_259.20'><ins class='correction' title='‘officers,'>‘officers,’</ins></a></span>
but it signifies <em>those who are in the circle</em> of a king or god, hence
‘ministrants,’ ‘courtiers,’ as in the rubric of Chapter CXXV.</p>

This of itself is not an argument against its antiquity, and there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>really no reason for supposing it to be less ancient than the chapter
which precedes it. The latter portion of the text is, however, very

<i>O Rā.</i> The name of the god is sometimes omitted in MSS.
The context, however, requires its presence. It may nevertheless
be asked: how can the Sun-god be said to be shining in the night?</p>

<p class='c000'>The question might as pertinently be asked: how can Horus (in
the very same line) be said to come forth in the night? The answer
to both these questions is that the Sun, whether as Rā or as Horus
or Osiris, shines in the night through the agency of Thoth, the Moon.

<em>He putteth on Hu.</em> This, is certainly obscure; but it is not
the less in conformity with the doctrine of the Pyramid texts. The
deceased (<cite>Pepi</cite> I. 432, <cite>Merira</cite> 618) is borne to a region where he is
fed from night till daybreak, and then seizes upon the god Hu,

<cite>Teta</cite>, 250) the deceased seizes (<img class="hiero" src="images/h1704.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" />) upon Hu, and after Sau has

is the name of the mythological serpent which personifies the subterranean
path from West to East of the Sun’s nightly course. In
the <cite>Book of Hades</cite> (<i>e.g.</i> on the Sarcophagus of Seti, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>passim</i></span>) it is
represented as extending over the back, top and front of the shrine
in which the Sun-god is borne in his Bark. The many folds of the
serpent are symbolical of the turnings and windings of the river or
canal (<img class="hiero" src="images/h1706.jpg" height="20" alt="⁂" />) over which the god is conveyed. This river is here
described as infinite in length. This is one of the instances from
which it is clear <img class="hiero" src="images/h1707.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h038.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, like the corresponding Coptic <span class='large'>ⲟⲩⲉⲓ</span>,
has the meaning of <em>length</em>. See <cite>P.S.B.A.</cite>, XVII, 190.</p>

<p class='c000'>The length ‘from West to East’ is described as ‘from <i>Amur</i> to

from many texts to signify the West (see <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>supra</i></span>, Chapter 64, <a href='#note64.13'>note 13</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>The East is known as <i>Ta-ur</i> or <i>Ta-urit</i>. The royal Ritual at Abydos

Bibl. Arch.</cite>, VI, 131, is the moon’s <em>crescent</em>, which during its course
through the sky is always turned towards the sun; so that a line at
right angles to the chord of the arc passes through the sun’s centre.
From this “very delicate observation,” as Arago calls it, the
Alexandrian astronomer Geminus infers that the moon derives
its light from the sun. The observation evidently had been made
in Egypt some thousands of years before Geminus, and explains

<p class='c000'>That the subject of these attributes is the Osiris is seen by

Miss Brockelhurst’s. It cannot however be the <i>Ax</i> of M. Naville,

<p class='c000'>The disappearance of the god’s name from all other documents

<p class='c000'>The two chapters which are numbered by M. Naville as 136<span class='fss'>A</span>
and 136<span class='fss'>B</span> are represented in the later recensions by a single
chapter, which has been made out of them. There is very much
obscurity in the ancient texts, though the MSS. containing them
are numerous, and the more recent versions are quite as difficult
to understand. We must be satisfied for the present by a strict
literal and grammatical translation, wherever this amount of success
is attainable. The royal sarcophagus 32 of the British Museum
gives the latest form of 136<span class='fss'>A</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note136.1'/><a href='#nref136.1'>1.</a>
<em>Light</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h057.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h213.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. A common noun signifying <em>lamp</em>, but
the determinative here shows that a heavenly body is meant. The
sun is here spoken of exactly in the same poetical way as when
Antigone (879) speaks of τόδε λαμπάδος ἱερὸν ὄμμα, or Virgil of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Phœboea lampas</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note136.2'/><a href='#nref136.2'>2.</a>
The later recension speaks of “the Lamp in Annu and the
Hammemit in <a id='corr272.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Cherāba.'>Cherāba.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_272.24'><ins class='correction' title='Cherāba.'>Cherāba.”</ins></a></span> This reading is already found in a few
of the Theban texts. The royal sarcophagus 32 of the British
Museum gives the important variant <img class="hiero" src="images/h1748.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h085.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h092.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <span class='xlarge'>=</span> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1749.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h504.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h092.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,
whence it follows that <img class="hiero" src="images/h504.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is phonetically <span class='xlarge'>=</span> <img class="hiero" src="images/h085.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The latter sign has

That
the latter is the true equivalent of <img class="hiero" src="images/h504.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is certain, in consequence
of the complementary vowels <img class="hiero" src="images/h841.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which commonly accompany
that sign, whether in the word signifying <em>battle</em>, or in the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>a place. It is <em>impossible</em> that <img class="hiero" src="images/h026.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h085.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> a should be the right

The corrections I have to make are the following:--I wrongly assumed that the <em>fish</em>
which in hieratic papyri crosses the foot of the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h085.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /> in the variants of <img class="hiero" src="images/h504.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" />
was the same fish as we find in the group <img class="hiero" src="images/h1752.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <span class='large'>=</span> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1753.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h055.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h561.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /> <span class='large'>=</span> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1754.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" />.
The fishes are different. On referring to M. Naville’s <cite>Festival Hall of Osorkon II</cite>,
pl. 18, pictures will be found of the <img class="hiero" src="images/h996.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1755.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and the <img class="hiero" src="images/h504.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1755.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" />. The
first of these is clearly the fish in <img class="hiero" src="images/h1752.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <i>ḥem-reu</i>, and the corresponding sign
in the variant is to be read <img class="hiero" src="images/h1756.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, <i>ḥem</i>, in harmony with the other evidence
produced by W. Max Müller (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Recueil</cite></span>, vol. IX). The picture of it does not
enable one to determine its species. The pictures at Bubastis of the <img class="hiero" src="images/h504.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1755.jpg" height="25" alt="⁂" />
seem to indicate the <em>Synodontis</em>, but a picture found by Petrie (<cite>Medum</cite>, pl. 12)
shows an immense fish which has been identified with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Latus</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Perca</i></span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nilotica</i></span>. This being of the Acanthopterygian family is of course a very
formidable <em>warrior</em>, like our own small perch, which, as Mr. Ward says, “does
not yield its life without endangering the person of its captor, for the formidable
rows of spinous rays belonging to the first dorsal fin have wounded the hands of
many an incautious angler.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two most ancient authorities for this chapter, as it is found
in the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span> and the late recension, are one of the four
tablets of the Museum of Marseilles, published by M. Naville (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les
quatre stèles orientées du Musée de Marseille</cite></span>), and the Berlin papyrus
of Nechtuamon. The chapter which M. Naville has published as
137<span class='fss'>A</span>, in the first volume of his own <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>, and which is taken
from the papyrus of Nebseni, is manifestly, I think, not the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>text, but another edition very considerably revised and enlarged.
And, in imitation of the rubric of ch. 64, it concludes with a veracious
statement, that it was discovered by Prince Hortatef in a secret
chest in the temple of Unnut, and was brought away by the royal
carriages.</p>

<p class='c000'>These texts are found among the texts preserved in the tomb
of Petamenemapt (see <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>, 1883, Taf. 1), but with various
additions, and have been appropriated by the Ritual of Ammon,
published by Dr. O. von Lemm.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the last days of his life, the lamented Sir Peter Le Page
Renouf, foreseeing that he would not be able to reach the goal he had
been striving to attain, the completion of his translation of the Book
of the Dead, expressed the wish that the writer of these lines should
continue and complete his work. I did not feel at liberty to go
against the desire of the eminent master, who had done me the
honour to choose me as his successor, and to leave unfinished a
work which he had kept in view all his life long, and which he considered
to be the choicest fruit of his Egyptological researches.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I had hardly set myself to the task, when I realised the
difficulties which were in my way. It is never easy, even for a
translator, to put himself into the place of another, to enter fully
into his views, to reconstitute the conception he had formed of the
book he had to interpret. To these difficulties must be added, that I
had hardly any help with regard to that part of the book which
Renouf has not published himself. Renouf, like many eminent
scholars, had his learning chiefly in his head; his notes are very
scanty, mere scraps without any methodical order. There is not a
line of written translation left, beyond what he printed himself.
Thus, for the translation of the following chapters, I was entirely
dependent on the part already published, and I had constantly to
refer to those chapters, in order to know the sense which Renouf
would have given to words and sentences I came across in the
course of my work.</p>

<p class='c000'>I endeavoured as much as I could, to translate as Renouf would
have done. Whenever it was possible, I used his words or his
readings, though I did not always agree with them. I followed
his choice of texts. He generally took the oldest one he had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>which he frequently found in my edition. On the whole I tried
to continue the work on the lines which Renouf himself adopted.
Thus it cannot be said absolutely that this translation is my work;
Egyptological scholars will soon recognize what is mine, and the
interpretations for which I am not responsible. I beg the reader
to look at my work in this light, and to remember that at present
any translation of the Book of the Dead is tentative and provisional,
and liable, with the progress in our knowledge of Egyptian, to
undergo considerable changes. Nevertheless, I hope that this joint
work will not compare too unfavourably with the part done by my
illustrious predecessor.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><i>The book read on the last day of Mechir, when the Eye is full on the last day of Mechir.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There rises a form which shines on the horizon. Atmu rises
pouring out his dew, and the bright one who shines in the sky.
The abode of the obelisk is in joy because of them, because they
are complete. There are shouts of joy in the sanctuary and loud
cheering fills the Tuat. They fall down before Atmu Harmachis.
For His Majesty gave orders to the cycle of his followers. His
Majesty ordered to give praise to the Eye, and behold, my flesh he
gave it strength, and all my limbs are renewed, as soon as the order
came out of the mouth of Rā.</p>

<p class='c000'>His glorious Eye rests on its place on His Majesty in this hour
of the night. When the fourth hour is accomplished, the world is
joyous in the last day of Mechir, for the Majesty of the Eye is in the
presence of the cycle of the gods, and His Majesty rises as from the
beginning, with the Eye on his head as Rā Atmu.</p>

<p class='c000'>The(<a id='nref140.1'></a><a href='#note140.1'>1</a>) eyes of Shu, Seb, Osiris, Suti, Horus, Menthu, Ptah,
Raneheh, Thoth, Chati, Nai, Eternity, Necht, Mert, the land, he
who is born by himself. After the computation of the eye has been
made in the presence of this god, and when it is full and completed,
all these gods are joyous on that day, they who were silent;(<a id='nref140.2'></a><a href='#note140.2'>2</a>) and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>behold there is a festival made to every god; and they say: hail to
thee, praise from Rā, the boatmen tow his boat, Apepi is struck
down. Hail to thee, praise from Rā who causes the form of
Chepera to exist; hail to thee, praise from Rā, there is joy in him,
his enemies are conquered; hail to thee, praise from Rā, who has
repelled the chiefs of the sons of the rebellion. Acclamation to
thee and praise to Osiris <i>N</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Said on an eye of pure lapis-lazuli or <i>mak</i> stone, ornamented
with gold; an offering is made before it of all things good and holy,
when Rā puts it on (on his head) on the last day of Mechir; another
one is made of jasper, which a man will put on any of his limbs he
likes. When this chapter is read by one who is in the boat of Rā,
he is towed like the gods, he is like one of them, and he prescribes
what is done to him in the Netherworld.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this chapter has been read to its end, this is the copy of
the order of offerings made when the Eye is full: four burning
altars for Rā, four for the Eye, and four for these gods; what there
is on each of them is: five good pointed white loaves; five pointed
fruit cakes, five baskets of pastry, one measure of incense, one of
fruit and one of roast meat.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Notes.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The ancient papyri do not contain this chapter. The translation
is made from the Turin <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Todtenbuch</cite></span>, supplemented and corrected
from hieratic papyri in Paris. Its real meaning is difficult to understand.
It seems that under symbolical expressions it refers to an
astronomical phenomenon, the renewal of the sun after the winter
solstice. According to the principle which I have adopted, to maintain
my predecessor’s interpretations, I translated <img class="hiero" src="images/h1795.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h007.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1796.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
“the Eye is full” (<i>cf.</i> Notes on ch. 125, p. 214). But as it seems
evident that here the two eyes of the sun are the two periods of his
apparent course, the decrease and the growth, I should translate
“the period is accomplished,” this period being that of the decrease
after which the sun enters its ascending course, or according to
Egyptian ideas begins again to grow. It is natural that the completing
of the period should be hailed with joy by Rā, since it is the
final victory over his enemies, which sets him free and allows him to
rise again as at the beginning. The sign of his triumph is that he
puts the <img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h007.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h134.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1797.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> on his head, as we see in the vignette.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span><a id='note140.1'/><a href='#nref140.1'>1.</a>
Why this list of gods comes here, it is difficult to understand.
It seems quite out of place. Their number varies according to the
papyri. In some of them, they are put after the text in vertical
columns. I presume they are the divinities often alluded to as <em>these
gods</em>. They are the witnesses of the scene of Rā rising with the Eye
on his head.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note140.2'/><a href='#nref140.2'>2.</a>
I have adopted the reading of the Paris papyrus, III, 58,
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1341.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h527.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1792.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignettes consist, in the Turin papyrus, of the deceased
worshipping a black Anubis lying down on a naos, and having on
his back the sign <img class="hiero" src="images/h1800.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. This god is the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1800.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h111.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> first mentioned.
Behind him are the <img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h007.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1796.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, a human form with the Eye
on its head, and Harmachis. Several papyri have only the Eye and
Harmachis.</p>

See <a href='#note133.1'>note 1</a> to ch. 133. I cannot quite agree with Renouf as
to the meaning of the word <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1801.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h038.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. It seems to me that its
sense is not so much that of “making someone mighty,” as of “distinguishing
him, making him eminent” in the opinion of his god or
his master, so that he may become his lord’s favourite. I consider
the meaning of <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1801.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h038.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1802.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> as similar to that of <img class="hiero" src="images/h1806.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c013'>O ye, these gates, who are the gates to Osiris, ye who guard their
gates, ye who herald the things of the world to Osiris every day.
Osiris <i>N.</i> knows you--he knows your names; for he is born in
Restau, where all the glory of the horizon was given him. <i>N.</i>
receives the investiture in Pu, like the purification of Osiris. <i>N.</i>
receives the saying(<a id='nref144.4'></a><a href='#note144.4'>4</a>) in Restau, when he leads the gods on the
horizon with the ministrant, the protectors of Osiris. I am one of
them in their leading. <i>N.</i> is the glorious one, the lord of the
glorious, a glorious one who performs the rites. <i>N.</i> celebrates the
festival of the first day of the month; he is the herald in the
fifteenth day of the month. O thou who revolvest. <i>N.</i> carries
the sacred flame to the hand of Thoth in the night when he sails
through the sky as victor. <i>N.</i> passes on in peace, he navigates in
the boat of Rā. The attributes(<a id='nref144.5'></a><a href='#note144.5'>5</a>) of <i>N.</i> are the attributes of the
boat of Rā. <i>N.</i> has a name greater than yours, mightier than you
who are on the roads of Maāt.  <i>N.</i> hates what is corrupt. The
attributes of <i>N.</i> are the attributes of Horus, the firstborn of Rā,
who accomplishes his will. <i>N.</i> is not fettered, he is not driven
away from the gates of Osiris. <i>N.</i> is perfect, the lion god, the pure
one who follows Osiris Khent Amenta every day. His domains are
in Sechet hotepu among those who know the sacred rites, among
those who perform the sacred rites to Osiris. <i>N.</i> is on the side of
Thoth, among those who bring offerings. Anubis ordered to the
bearers of offerings, that there should be offerings to <i>N.</i> of his own,
and that they should not be taken from him by those who are in
captivity. <i>N.</i> has come like Horus, when he adorns the horizon of
heaven <i>N.</i> directs the march of Rā towards the gates of the
horizon; therefore the gods rejoice in the presence of <i>N.</i> The
divine scent(<a id='nref144.6'></a><a href='#note144.6'>6</a>) is upon Osiris, the god with the lock(<a id='nref144.7'></a><a href='#note144.7'>7</a>) will not
reach him; the keepers of the gates will not be hostile to him.
<i>N.</i> is the one whose face is hidden inside the palace, in the
sanctuary of the god, the lord of Tuat. <i>N.</i> has reached it after
Hathor. <i>N.</i> gathers his hosts; he brings Maāt to Rā, he drives
away the Mighty One, Apepi. <i>N.</i> pierces the steel firmament(<a id='nref144.8'></a><a href='#note144.8'>8</a>),
and repels the raging storm; he gives life to the seamen of Rā. <i>N.</i>
carries offerings to the place where it (the boat) is. <i>N.</i> causes that
the boat gives him a successful voyage. <i>N.</i> marches, and when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>reaches it, the face of <i>N.</i> is like the Great One, and his back like the
lofty one. <i>N.</i> is the lord of the mighty. <i>N.</i> is well pleased on the
horizon. <i>N.</i> is valiant; he strikes you down; you wakers; he
makes his way to your lord, Osiris.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is on the copy which is in the books(<a id='nref144.9'></a><a href='#note144.9'>9</a>). It is written in
yellow ink, on the sacred circle of gods in the boat of Rā(<a id='nref144.10'></a><a href='#note144.10'>10</a>),
where offerings are made of victuals, geese, incense, in their
presence, in order to revive the deceased, to make him powerful
among the gods, and that he may not be repulsed nor driven
back from the pylons of the Tuat. If thou readest it to the statue
of this deceased in their presence, it causes him to have access
to every hall of those which are in the books.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is said at the entrance of every gate, of those which are
in the books, and to each of them an offering is made of the
haunch, the head, the heart, and the hoof of a red bull, and four
vases of blood which does not come from the heart, and scent
vases, and sixteen pointed white loaves, and eight round loaves,
and eight <i>chenfu</i> loaves, and eight <i>hebennu</i> loaves, eight casks of
beer, eight vases of dry corn, four tanks of earthenware filled with
the milk of a white cow, fresh herbs, fresh olive oil, green eye
paint, antimony, odoriferous oils, and burning incense. Said while
putting on a clay seal twice.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this copy has been read, if the fourth hour is going round in
the day, beware of what is threatening in the sky; but if thou hast
read this book without any human being seeing it, it will widen the
steps of the deceased in heaven or earth, and in the Tuat; because
this book exalts the deceased more than any ceremony performed to
him, henceforth, from this day undeviatingly for times infinite.</p>

<p class='c000'>This chapter is the first of a series of four (144-147), in which the
old versions differ considerably from the Turin text. 144 and 147

Brugsch calls them “watch-towers, pylons,” Pierret “stations.”
Maspero considers them as the old “ergastules,” a kind of vaulted
hall. Jéquier speaks of them as “magazines,” but generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>translates the word by “pylons.” Renouf, in his <a id='corr290.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='introducton'>introduction</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_290.1'><ins class='correction' title='introducton'>introduction</ins></a></span> to the

“pylons.” In another place he says the <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h079.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h916.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is not a mere
gate, but a <em>hold</em> or <em>keep</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we refer to the old texts where this chapter is mixed together
with chapter 146, we see that the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1814.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h004.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h353.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is a door, a gate,
which has to be passed in order to reach the <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h079.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h916.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.

gods of the Tuat.</p>

<p class='c000'>144 and 147 are two different versions of the same chapter, and
no old papyrus has them both. It is the same with chapters 145 and
146. Evidently before the Saitic period, for these chapters, as for
the 15th, there was no received text, and the writers had the choice
between various versions which the compilers of the Turin text
collected together. There are seven <img class="hiero" src="images/h1814.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h004.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1815.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, and the deceased
who approaches them has to know three names; first, the <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1816.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1817.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h038.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />

styled in chapter 147 <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1816.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1817.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1818.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. But if we consider that in
some of the old papyri the name of the man is that of the gate itself,
<img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1816.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1817.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h038.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> has to be translated <em>he who belongs to</em>, the occupant,
the inhabitant, a sense which does not disagree with the word
<img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1816.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1817.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1818.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> since, according to Oriental customs, the master of
a house is generally met with at the door, at the entrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>doorkeeper</em>, the <em>watcher</em> (Budge), or the <em>warder</em> (Renouf),
is the second person, <img class="hiero" src="images/h1820.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1817.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h410.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <em>he who guards

<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>reports to Osiris every day the things of the world, and I suppose
also, who is coming towards the gate. Renouf calls this person <em>the
teller</em>. I shall use the word <em>herald</em>, which I adopted previously.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the six old texts which I collated, we find only the reciting of
the three names. The Papyrus of Nu in the British Museum alone

<p class='c000'>Chapters 145 and 146 are two versions of the same text. They
are the chapter of the arrival of the deceased to the <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h079.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h916.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
of the house of Osiris. It is difficult to know what these <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h079.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h916.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
really are. Renouf translates the word by <em>pylon</em>. At the same time
he says they are not mere gates, but keeps or holds. I shall use his
word pylon; but the word which seems to me to convey most
exactly the meaning is a <em>cell</em>, since each of the <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h079.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h136.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />
has an inhabitant. There are various versions of these chapters.
The oldest, No. 146, is found in several papyri, and has been
translated from <i>Lc.</i> (Leyden), the only one which has the
chapter complete. It consists of 21 paragraphs, each of which
begins with a sentence giving the names of the pylon. It is
followed by that of the <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1835.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1837.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1836.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, which I translate, with
Renouf, the <em>porter</em> or <em>doorkeeper</em> though I should prefer, he who is
within the door, since the vignettes show that the so-called porter or
doorkeeper is the god who occupies the cell. There are 21 pylons,
out of which the papyri give us a certain number. Brugsch finds
in their names those of some of the hours of night or day; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>fact of their being 21, absolutely precludes the idea of these pylons
being the hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The papyrus of <em>Nu</em> in the British Museum gives a slightly different
version of this chapter 146. Each pylon is introduced by these
words, “said by Nu when he arrives at the first pylon: I have
arrived, I know thee, I know the name of the god who guardeth
thee; the lady of trembling, &amp;c., is thy name, the name of the
doorkeeper is the brave.” The other version which constitutes
chapter 145 shows that the god who guardeth the pylon and the
doorkeeper are the same person.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter 145 is the same text which has been spun out a little
more. We have no older copy of it than the fragments in the tomb
of Meneptah Siphtah and queen Tauser, which give us only eleven
pylons, with a very incorrect text. As for the Turin text, it is so
hopelessly corrupt, especially in the most important part, the names,
that I did not attempt to translate it. Then chapter 145 is the text
of Nu for 146 still more developed. In the version of the royal tomb,
each paragraph is called: “The salutation of Osiris, the king, to the
pylon: I know thee, I know thy name, I know the name of the god
who guardeth thee.” Then follow the name of the pylon, and that
of the god, and after having said them, the deceased describes the
purifications he goes through, the oils with which he has been
anointed, and the text ends with these words: pass on, thou art pure.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is curious that both in 145 and 146 there is a change at the
pylon No. 11. In our text, <em>Lc</em>, the name of the doorkeeper
disappears, and each time, after the name of the pylon, we find these
words: <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h017.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1839.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1838.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h183.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h338.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h134.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h147.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h470.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h190.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.
In 145 the name of the doorkeeper is still mentioned, but this
sentence takes the place of the description of the purifications and
ointments which occurred in the previous paragraphs. I should translate
these words: <em>she will direct or prepare the enwrapping or clothing
of the dead</em>. I think that the dead is supposed to wear a different
garment at each pylon, which is provided to him by the pylon itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>A still more detailed version of 145 is found in the Paris papyrus
<em>Pg</em>, of which we have only a very short fragment. At each
pylon there is a dialogue between the deceased and doorkeeper,
who asks whether the deceased has been purified, in what water,
with what oil he has been anointed, which garment he wears, which
stick he holds in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Chapters 145 and 146 are among the most incorrect texts of the
Book of the Dead, and until we have new copies of the old versions,
there will always be a large measure of conjecture in any attempt to
translate them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter 147 is very like 144, in fact, it is the same more developed.
It refers also to the seven gates; and whenever the deceased
approaches one of the gates, he has to say the name of the doorkeeper,
which, as we saw before, is that of the gate itself; and also
the name of the warder and that of the herald. Besides the deceased
has to address the gate, probably in order to open it so that he may
pass through. The words he utters are found in chapters 117, 119
and 136<span class='fss'>B</span>. The two first have nearly the same title, <em>the arrival at
Restau</em>, near Abydos. If, as is most probable, the various parts of
the Book of the Dead did not originate in the same place, we may
safely assert that these chapters, as well as those of the gates and
the pylons, come from Abydos.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole the Papyrus of Ani is more complete for chapter
147 than the Leyden text <i>Lc</i> which is published in my edition.
Therefore this chapter has been translated from Ani, using <i>Lc</i>
whenever Ani is too corrupt.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note147.1'/><a href='#nref147.1'>1.</a>
Chapter 119, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vide</i></span> p. 206, “Chapter whereby one entereth
and goeth forth from Restau.”</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note147.2'/><a href='#nref147.2'>2.</a>
I should translate: <em>which give to Restau its name</em>. This is an
instance of those wonderful etymologies often met with in religious
texts. From the word <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1167.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1850.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <em>to flow</em>, is derived the name
<img class="hiero" src="images/h055.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h626.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1851.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note147.3'/><a href='#nref147.3'>3.</a>
The Osiris of the first gate whom the deceased addresses
seems to be the moon. The word <img class="hiero" src="images/h1824.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1852.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is often used in speaking
of the pale and silvery light of the moon (Naville, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Litanie du soleil</cite></span>,
p. 54).</p>

<p class='c000'>The last sentences are found in chapter 117, line 3.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note147.4'/><a href='#nref147.4'>4.</a>

Chapter 136<span class='fss'>B</span>, line 14.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note147.6'/><a href='#nref147.6'>6.</a>
Chapter 136<span class='fss'>B</span>, line 18. I repeat Renouf’s translation,
though I differ from him in various points. For instance, I should
translate: <em>I have closed the doors in Restau</em> (<i>cf.</i> Inscr. of Piankhi,
line 104).</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note147.7'/><a href='#nref147.7'>7.</a>
An abridged version of chapter 119.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note147.8'/><a href='#nref147.8'>8.</a>
The rubric is taken from the Paris papyrus <i>Pc</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There also the vignettes vary considerably according to the fancy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of the artist. In <i>Lc</i> the gates and the gods are all alike. In <i>Pc</i>
the god is always represented in human form with a ram’s head. In
the Papyrus of Ani, where there are three figures for each gate, these
figures are all different.</p>

<p class='c000'>This chapter in the Turin text begins with a long title which is
found by itself in the papyrus of <i>Nu</i>. Dr. Budge considers it as a
special chapter, to which he has given No. 190. But the proof that
it is not a chapter, is that the whole of it is written in red, which
means that it is a title; besides this title is that of one of the hymns
which constitute chapter 15, the hymn to the setting sun (15 <span class='fss'>B</span>, 3).
The chapter itself begins with the last word in line 7 of the Turin
text. We have a nearly complete version of it in the tomb of
Senmut, the architect of queen Hatshepsu. The text from which I
translate is compiled from several Theban papyri.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note148.1'/><a href='#nref148.1'>1.</a>
Renouf translates the word in various ways: “sustenance,
nutriment, dainties, delicacies.”</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note148.2'/><a href='#nref148.2'>2.</a>
Note the connection between these two ideas which occurs
throughout the chapter: the giving nourishment to the deceased
delivers him from all evil.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note148.3'/><a href='#nref148.3'>3.</a>
To be suckled by the divine cows, like Hatshepsu at Der el
Bahari, by Hathor.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note148.4'/><a href='#nref148.4'>4.</a>
Several papyri have here the rubric of 30<span class='fss'>B</span>, with the name of
Mycerinus. The rubric which is here translated is taken from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>papyrus of <i>Nu</i>. Lepsius calls 148<span class='fss'>C</span> the vignettes belonging to this
chapter. In a columned hall stands Osiris, and behind him the
cows, the rudders, and the four gods of the cardinal points. Osiris
is sometimes left out. In the papyrus of Ani the god has his hair
painted green, and he stands on a green basement.</p>

bones and establishes firmly his limbs. Ahi, the lord of hearts,
came to me, he joined my bones, and as he fixed the diadem of
Tmu, he fastened on me the head of Nehebkau, and established my

<p class='c000'>I am with you, I live with you, ye gods who are within the
domain of Unt.</p>

<p class='c000'>You love me more than your gods. I am with you for ever, in
the presence of the followers of the great god.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thirteenth domain. O this domain of the water, which
none of the glorious ones can possess, for its water is of fire, its
stream is burning, and its heat is of blazing flame, so that they may
not drink its water in order to quench the thirst which is within
them, for their mighty fear, and their great terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gods and the glorious ones look at its water from afar, they
do not quench their thirst, and their heart is not set at rest, because
they may not go near it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the river is full and green like the flowing sap which
comes out of Osiris, I take its water, I draw from its flood like the
great god who is in the domain of the water, and who keeps watch
over it for fear that the gods may drink from its water, and who
inspires dread to the glorious ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hail to thee, thou great god, who art in the domain of the water.
I have come to thee. Grant me to take of thy water, to take of thy
stream, as thou doest to this great god.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Nile will come, when he will give birth to the plants,
and cause the herbs to grow; as it is given to the gods, when he
appears in peace, grant that the Nile may come to me, and that I
may take his plants; for I am thy own son for ever.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fourteenth domain. O this domain of Cher-āba(<a id='nref149.15'></a><a href='#note149.15'>15</a>), which
drives the Nile towards Tattu, and which causes the Nile to go and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>spend its corn in his course from <i>Rokekmu</i>(<a id='nref149.16'></a><a href='#note149.16'>16</a>); thou which presentest
offerings to the dead, and mortuary gifts to the glorious ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a serpent belonging to it, who comes from the two wells
at Elephantine, at the gate of the water. He goes with the water,
and stops at the stream of Cher-āba, near the powers of the high
flood; he sees his hour of the silent evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ye gods who live in the water of Cher-āba, ye powers of the
high flood, open to me your ponds, open to me your lakes, that I
may take of your water, and that I may rest in your stream, that I
may eat of your corn, that I may be satisfied with your food.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have risen, my heart is high, for I am the great god in
Cher-āba.</p>

<p class='c000'>Make me offerings. I have been filled with the vital sap coming
out of Osiris. I shall not be despoiled of it. The end.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is one of the interesting chapters of the Book of the Dead.
It is more frequently met with than the other ones, and it generally
constitutes the end of the Theban papyri. It is the chapter of the
various domains which the deceased has to reach, and in which he
enjoys special privileges.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignettes generally give the plan of the domain, and very
often the colour with which it is painted; they are either green
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1291.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1853.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or light yellow <img class="hiero" src="images/h1854.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1855.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. In most of the papyri there are
only four yellow--3, 9, 10, and 14.</p>

<p class='c000'>Renouf translates <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1856.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> “domain” (p. 208). Dr. Budge
keeps the word <i>aat</i>, and considers them as the divisions of the
Elysian fields. Pierret translates <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>demeure</i></span>, Brugsch <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>siège</i></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>demeure</i></span>,
<em>habitation</em>. I shall adopt Renouf’s word, though <em>residence</em> or
<em>habitation</em> seems to me preferable. An <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1856.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is an enclosed
space which has inhabitants described or mentioned in the text.
The deceased calls first on the domain, and often in the same breath
goes over to the inhabitants without any transition.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note149.1'/><a href='#nref149.1'>1.</a>
The second domain is the horizon. The text of the vignette
says: the god who is in it is Harmachis. The text to this domain
being a repetition of chapter 109, I adopt Renouf’s translation
(p. 181.)</p>

The deceased speaks of himself as a magician who can cover
the head of the serpent without being hurt. The eyes of the
serpent, which have the power of paralyzing, of making impotent
(see seventh domain), are given him; the result is, that when he
goes to the mountain on which the serpent shows his strength, this
strength collapses, as the deceased says: thy strength is in my hand;
I am he who lifts, who takes away the strength.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>With Chapter 151 begins a series of texts written either on the
walls of the funeral chamber or on the mummy cloth, or on various
amulets. This series goes as far as 160, with the exception of 152
and 153, which have been inserted there without any apparent
reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter 151 is not so much a text as a picture. It represents
the funeral chamber. The four walls, which should be vertical, are
drawn lying flat on the ground. In the middle of the chamber,
under a canopy, is the mummy, on which Anubis lays his hands;
under the bed is a bird with a human head, the symbol of the soul
of the deceased. We must suppose that the god Anubis is a priest,
or a member of the family, who has put on a jackal’s head, and who
pronounces the words said to be those of the god. At the foot of
the bed are the two goddesses Isis and Nephthys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each of the four walls had a small niche of the exact size of
an amulet, which was lodged in it. We know it from the four
oriented steles of Marseilles (Naville, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les quatre stèles orientées du
Musée de Marseille</cite></span>), where we find the text belonging to each wall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>and also the niche cut in the stone for each amulet. On the North
was a human figure, on the South a flame, on the East a jackal,
on the West a Tat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the chamber were four so-called canopic vases, with the gods
of the four cardinal points, each of whom has his words to say.
Besides these were statuettes called <i>shabti</i> or <i>ushabti</i>, the helpers of
the deceased in his work in the Elysian fields. In the papyrus
London, 10010 (<i>Af.</i>), from which this chapter is translated, one of
them has the usual appearance, the other the head of Anubis.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soul of the deceased is supposed to be in the chamber, and
to worship the rising and the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very few papyri have this chapter as complete as <i>Af.</i>, which is
taken here as standard for text and vignettes, but there are fragments
of it here and there. The Turin version is much shorter than the
old one. The papyrus of <i>Nu</i> (ed. Budge) contains the texts of the
four walls with rubrics very similar to those of the steles in Marseilles.
They form a special chapter joined to 137<span class='fss'>A</span>, with the title: <i>What is
done secretly in the Tuat, the mysteries of the Tuat, the introduction
into the mysteries of the Netherworld.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>In order to facilitate the understanding of the chapter, I have
lettered the words spoken by the various figures.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note151.1'/><a href='#nref151.1'>1.</a>
Renouf would have translated (see Chapter 42), thy eyebrows
are <em>those of</em> Anubis; but the following chapter shows that we have
to translate <em>with</em> Anubis, which should mean here, under the
protection of Anubis.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note151.2'/><a href='#nref151.2'>2.</a>
The rubrics say the figure is made of palm wood, and is seven
fingers high.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note151.3'/><a href='#nref151.3'>3.</a>
The rubric of this Tat is the following: <em>said on a Tat of
crystal, the branches of which are of gold. It is folded up in fine
linen.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>There is another chapter of the Tat put on the neck of the
deceased (Chapter 155), the words of which are totally different.</p>

the giver of written words. Thy locks are beautified before Ptah

<p class='c000'>The words spoken by Anubis in Chapter 151 have been taken
out and made into a special chapter, which in papyrus London,
9900 (<i>Aa</i>) occurs in two different forms. I called them CLI<span class='fss'>A</span> <i>bis</i>
and CLI<span class='fss'>A</span> <i>ter</i>, the second one being only an abridgement of the first.
Vignettes and titles are not the same for these two chapters. That
translated, CLI<span class='fss'>A</span> <i>bis</i>, is the longest of the two. The title of the
other one is: the <em>Chapter of the Mysterious Head</em>, and the vignette
thereof consists of a mummy’s head.</p>

<p class='c000'>In comparing this chapter with the words of Anubis we had
before, we find the explanation of expressions like this: thy eyebrows
are with Anubis.</p>

<img class="hiero" src="images/h1862.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. This word has always been translated <em>fingers</em>, a sense
which is evidently wrong in this place, where parts of the head only
are mentioned, and when one would expect the hair or the beard.</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose that this obscure sentence means that since everything
in him is divine the design or colour of his fingers (?) was taken from
the books of Thoth.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Theban version the Chapter of the Net is divided into two,
153<span class='fss'>A</span> and 153<span class='fss'>B</span>, which have different titles and different vignettes.
153<span class='fss'>A</span> is called the “<i>Chapter of coming out</i>,” or, as might be translated,
“<em>of escaping from the net</em>.” The vignettes represent a clap-net, used
for waterfowl. The second Chapter is called “<em>the Chapter of escaping
from those who catch</em> <img class="hiero" src="images/h1865.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1755.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />,” which, from the etymology,
might be translated <em>foul</em> or <em>fetid fish</em>. There the vignette represents
a drag-net containing fishes, and drawn by apes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable, one may suppose, that originally one Chapter
referred to the fowlers, the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1866.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h004.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1151.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1867.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, who use the clap-net,
and the other to the fishermen, the <img class="hiero" src="images/h316.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1868.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1869.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1870.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, who
use the drag-net. But in the form in which these Chapters appear
in the three best texts where they have been preserved, London,
9900 (<i>Aa</i>), Paris, III, 93 (<i>Pb.</i>), and the papyrus of <i>Nu</i>, fowlers and
fishermen are mixed together.</p>

<p class='c000'>The text of 153<span class='fss'>A</span> is very corrupt, and seems to differ greatly
from the original. The variants between the chief documents are
considerable, and show that the understanding of it was nearly lost.
It probably had two different versions, which have been cast into
one, since after the first two-thirds it begins over again and nearly
repeats itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Turin text contains only 153<span class='fss'>A</span>, and that even much shorter,
but it is followed by a rubric, which is absent from the Theban
version.</p>

<p class='c000'>The translation is made from the three above-named documents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignette of 153<span class='fss'>A</span>, in the papyrus III, 93, of the Louvre (<i>Pb</i>),
shows a clap-net drawn by four men. Behind it comes the deceased,
holding in his hand two instruments mentioned in the text: the
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1874.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> and the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1871.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, called <img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1872.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1873.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h350.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> or <img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1875.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1873.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> each
of them consists of different parts having a distinct name.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the papyrus of <i>Nu</i> the deceased is seen drawing the rope of
the net.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the vignette of London, 9900 (<i>Aa</i>), he is supposed to do the
same.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span><a id='note153a.1'/><a href='#nref153a.1'>1.</a>
Among the dangers to which the deceased is exposed is that
of being caught in a net by hidden genii, who will treat him as is
done to water-fowl or fishes. But he escapes from this peril,
because he knows the names of the fowlers and fishermen who
intend to attack him, and also of the net itself, and of the various
parts of which it consists. All these names are mystical; they are
connected with some divinity, and this gives them a magical power,
owing to which the deceased can make his escape.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note153a.2'/><a href='#nref153a.2'>2.</a>
I suppose this means fishermen, sons of fishermen.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note153a.3'/><a href='#nref153a.3'>3.</a>
Litt. the hands: the bars, the sides of the frame of the net.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note153a.4'/><a href='#nref153a.4'>4.</a>
The fingers are often mentioned when we should say the
hand. The act or the wound is attributed to the fingers. “Whose
fingers are hidden,” means he who hides the hand with which he will
strike.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note153a.5'/><a href='#nref153a.5'>5.</a>
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1874.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />. The instrument in the hand of the deceased. Though
the determinative is <img class="hiero" src="images/h350.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, it does not necessarily mean that it is
made of wood; it may be the determinative of weapons in general.
It has prongs, which are compared to nails or claws, so that it
probably is a weapon like the bident for spearing fishes, the tines
of which are held together by a string (Wilkinson, <cite>Manners and
Customs</cite>, 2nd edition, Vol. II, p. 107). Otherwise it is not unlike
a netting needle (Wilkinson, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 175). If it is a weapon, one
does not very well understand why it is said to belong to the net.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note153a.6'/><a href='#nref153a.6'>6.</a>

which the end of the clap-net is fastened. But it must be noticed
that in the vignette of London, 9900, this peg is a dagger. <a id='corr318.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Therefor'>Therefore</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.26'><ins class='correction' title='Therefor'>Therefore</ins></a></span>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter is not frequently met with in the papyri; it was
written on the wrappings and the bandages of the dead; for instance,
on the funeral cloth of King Thothmes III, where it is not complete.
This Chapter is interesting, as it shows how repulsive to the Egyptians
was the idea of corruption, of the decay of the body, which is
described here in most realistic terms. This is one of the reasons
why they gave such importance to mummification.</p>

<p class='c000'>Parts of this Chapter are very obscure. The translation has been
made from the text on the mummy cloth of Thothmes III, supplemented

The passage is very obscure.
I believe the drift of the idea is this: after having described very
thoroughly what corruption is, the deceased says: as for me I am
protected against those evils. Even should every being fall into
corruption, having lost the eye of Shu, it is nothing to me, because I
am feared by all.</p>

by two passages. At Abydos the priest says to the god (Mar.,
<i>Abydos</i>, I, p. 34) <img class="hiero" src="images/h1909.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1910.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1911.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1912.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h064.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1909.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1910.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1911.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h273.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.
“I have come to perform the ceremonies, for I have not come to do
nothing, I have not come in vain.” In the poem of Pentaur, when
Rameses II, addressing Amen, recalls all he has done to honour the
god, he says: <img class="hiero" src="images/h273.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h2022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h251.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h004.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h173.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1914.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h105.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1915.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1218.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026c.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1916.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h099.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1086.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />:

The eye of Shu is either an amulet or a magic power residing

It is the defence against corruption. Further the deceased says:

<p class='c000'>After the interruption due to Chapters 153 and 154, we revert
to the series inaugurated by 151, the description of the chamber in
which the mummy is deposited, and of the funeral equipment of the
deceased, his amulets and ornaments. The papyrus III, 93 (Pb),
of the Louvre, throws several of these Chapters into one, with the
title: <em>the description of the hidden things of the Tuat</em>, and the vignette
(Pl. LV) represents three figures of Chapter 151: the statuette, the
torch or flame, and the Anubis; besides two <em>Tat</em> of different
substances, one of them for the wall, and one to be put on the neck
of the deceased, and a buckle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignette of Chapter 155 represents a Tat of gold. The
various versions of the Chapter differ mostly in the rubric. I followed
the papyrus of Nebseni (Aa), filling up the gaps from other texts.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note155.1'/><a href='#nref155.1'>1.</a>
The rubric seems to explain that the text refers to a Tat of
gold, which is inlaid into the wood of a mummy-shaped coffin, on
the neck, and which holds fast by means of the sap or gum of a tree
or fruit called <i>ankhamu</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span><a id='note155.2'/><a href='#nref155.2'>2.</a>

<p class='c000'>Chapters 162-165 are of a very date date. They are of a different
character from the other chapters of the Book of the Dead. They
belong rather to the magic books of the old Egyptians. When they
were written there was a decay in the religion, which drifted more
and more into magic, for which the Egyptians were famous under
the Roman Empire. We find there a great number of barbarous
words unintelligible to us, and probably also to the old scribes, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>they differ widely according to the papyri. They remind us of those
which are found in the magical texts (Chabas, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Pap. Magique Harris</cite></span>,
p. 151)</p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that Chapter 162 is older than the following; several
papyri end with it, and it has the rubric <img class="hiero" src="images/h171.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h072.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1825.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> <em>this is the
end</em>, which is found in the older texts after Chapter 149.</p>

<p class='c000'>The late Dr. Pleyte, of Leyden, made a special study of these
chapters, and of several others of late date (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chapitres supplémentaires
du Livre des Morts, Texte, Traduction et Commentaire</cite></span>, Leide). The
collation which he published of various documents is the text on
which this translation has been made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignette generally consists of a cow, having between her
horns a solar disk, with two plumes. Occasionally behind her there
is a goddess with a cow’s head having the same attribute. This cow
I consider to be the goddess Nut, the mother of Rā. An image
of the cow, made of pure gold, is to be put on the neck of the
deceased; or, what would be much easier and cheaper, it is to be
painted on a hypocephalus of new papyrus, and put under the
deceased’s head. Part of this chapter is the usual text found on the
hypocephali.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of the gift of one of these amulets will be that in the
Netherworld the deceased will be surrounded by flames. This is the
effect of the presence of the amulets here described. It does not take
place in this world, but in the other, where Rā himself enjoys a similar
protection, being surrounded by “warriors of blazing fire.” This
image seems to point to the magnificent sunsets often seen in
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note162.1'/><a href='#nref162.1'>1.</a>
All the translators have interpreted <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h482.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> by “heat,” the
vital heat of the body. But this is not the true sense of the word,
which means “flame,” <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h482.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1922.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h482.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> “flame of fire.” The root
<img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> implies the idea of darting, springing forth like a flame or a
spark, and not of latent heat. <img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h482.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h014.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1923.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> cannot mean anything
except a great quantity of flames. These flames will be the
protection of the deceased.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note162.2'/><a href='#nref162.2'>2.</a>
The lion addressed by the cow, a god of light and fire, is probably
Rā himself.</p>

These barbarous names, as well as those of the following

be looked for in the African languages, for Chapter 164 connects
them with the speech of the negroes, and the Anti of Nubia.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter begins with a general title applying to 163-5, and
probably to other ones not included in the papyrus of Turin:
“Chapters brought from another book, an addition to the coming
forth by day.” This means that these chapters were not considered
as belonging to the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1849.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h032.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1927.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h084.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1924.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> “the coming forth
by day,” the original Book of the Dead, which in old times ended
with Chapter 149, and later on with Chapter 162.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignettes represent the figures described in the rubric for
which the chapter was written.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Pleyte first discovered that this Chapter is a kind of dialogue,
consisting of words spoken by the god, and a prayer addressed to him
in favour of the deceased. The strange names which occur in the
text lead us here also to Africa, since it is said of the deceased that
he resides in Apt of Nubia, Napata.</p>

The amulet has also an influence on earth, it protects a man
against hidden dangers, which arise not from men but from
some invisible causes, and agents like those evil messengers,
probably spirits, who might be called “angels.” I believe that
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1929.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1930.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h026c.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h121.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1747.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, “the blow of the king,” must mean some
sudden illness like <img class="hiero" src="images/h003.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1931.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h022.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h121.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1747.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.  Dr. Pleyte also considers
this part of the rubric as applying to a man’s life on earth; there is
only this expression <img class="hiero" src="images/h1849.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h554.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h280.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h063.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which does not agree with this
explanation, and would rather lead us to think that what is described
in this part of the rubric takes place in the other world.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note165.1'/><a href='#nref165.1'>1.</a>
The explanation to this extraordinary title seems to be given in
the last sentence of the rubric, where it is said of the deceased: “he
drinks the running water of the stream, he shines like a star in the
sky.” The amulet for which this text was written will prevent the
deceased, who is to be as bright as a star, from having his light taken
from him, from being obscured. The other blessing conferred upon
him is that of drinking water of the stream. It is difficult to say why
these two blessings alone are mentioned.</p>

That his body may be reconstituted. It is curious to find in
so late texts a vague remembrance of what seems to have been the
prevalent custom in prehistoric times, and perhaps also during the
Thinite period: the dismemberment of the body of the deceased. This
custom was so entirely superseded by the opposite process, the
mummification and the careful preservation of the body, that the old
tradition is always mentioned with horror and disgust. The Book of
the Dead is full of objurgations against the dismemberment of the
body.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Chapter 166 begins a series of chapters which are not in the
Todtenbuch, and which have been collected from various papyri.
For most of them there is only one text, therefore the translation is
often very uncertain.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter, which is taken from London 9900 (<i>Aa</i>), seems to
be only a variant, with a few additional sentences, of Chapter 43,
“Chapter whereby the head of a person is not severed from him in
the Netherworld.” It alludes to the reconstitution of the body of
the deceased, and to providing him with all his sepulchral equipment.
Head-rests like that which is represented in the vignette are
often found in the tombs with the coffins already at the time of the
XIth dynasty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter 166 was first discovered and translated by Dr. Birch
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>, 1868, p. 82).</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note166.1'/><a href='#nref166.1'>1.</a>
Here begin the words of Chapter 43.</p>

taken as a patronymic, “flame-born.” Chapter 43 has <img class="hiero-b" src="images/h480.jpg" height="36" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1933.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h393.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h480.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1933.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h153.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />.</p>

After Rā had wounded(<a id='nref167.1'></a><a href='#note167.1'>1</a>) her, she was raging furiously and then

<p class='c000'>This Chapter taken also from London 9900, is a mere abridgment
of lines 30-34 in Chapter 17. It refers probably to an eclipse.
The Eye, the moon is pierced or wounded by Rā, which causes the
goddess to be furious. Then, according to Chapter 17, “Thoth calms
her troubled state (Brugsch), and brings her whole and sound without
any defect.” This is called to appease the goddess.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note167.1'/><a href='#nref167.1'>1.</a>
The correct reading according to Chapter 17, is:

  <h2 id='ch168' class='c005'>CHAPTER CLXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Chapter 168 should not have been placed among those of
the Book of the Dead, it belongs to another book similar to the
<img class="hiero" src="images/h302.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1937.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" />, the book engraved on the walls of the royal tombs. It

the Tuat</em> who confer certain blessings on the deceased; such as this:
“those who lift up their faces towards the sky at the prow of the
boat of Rā, grant that Osiris <i>N.</i> may see Rā when he rises.” A
vignette gives the appearance of the god or genius spoken of.
Every one of them is followed by this sentence: “for the libation
of a vase has been made on earth by Osiris <i>N.</i> who is (now) the
lord of abundance, and goes round the garden of Hotepit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The three versions which have been preserved of this text are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>very fragmentary. The most complete, papyrus 10478 of the British

this text, the character of which is chiefly pictorial, lies in the
vignettes, it has been thought unnecessary to give a translation of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter, which has no vignette, is found in one papyrus
only, written for a deceased of the name of Amenophis. Its
Theban origin is clearly indicated by the mention of Mentu and
Amon, the two great gods of Thebes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its character is different from the Book of the Dead in general.
It seems to be part of a ritual such as the Ritual of Amon and
Mut, with which it has a great likeness (see Moret, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Rituel du culte
divin</cite></span>, ch. 6). (1) The clothing in a pure or perhaps a clean garment,
will be the sign that all that was wrong in the deceased has been
destroyed by the gods. Therefore the deceased calls on them,
asking them to complete this destruction in order that he may shine
or be glorious, wearing the pure garment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is alluded to in the next Chapter (fifth verse), “thou
puttest on the pure garment, and thou divestest the apron, when
thou stretchest thyself on the funereal bed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter is taken also from London 9900. The vignette at
the end represents Osiris sitting in a naos. Before him are the
offerings of fowl and cattle which Horus presents to his father. At
the beginning the deceased is seen, with raised arms; he is supposed
to be Horus, and above him are written the following words:--“Adoration
to Osiris, Khenta Amenta, the great god, the lord of
Abydos, king for ever, prince of eternity, the venerable god in
Restau, pronounced by <i>N.</i>, I give thee grain, lord of the gods, the
one god who liveth on justice. I am thy son Horus. I have come
to thee. I avenge thee, I bring to thee Maat, to the place where is
the circle of thy gods. Grant me to be among thy followers, and to
smite thy enemies. I have established for thee thy food offerings
on the earth for ever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter was first published and translated in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschrift</cite></span>,
Vol. XIII, p. 83.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='note173.1'/><a href='#nref173.1'>1.</a>
These words are repeated before every one of the following
sentences.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note173.2'/><a href='#nref173.2'>2.</a>
This sentence is abridged. It is given in full by the Ritual
at Abydos: “I have anointed thy head with the oil of the brow of
Horus; if it is destroyed there (on his brow) he is destroyed as god;
<i>i.e.</i>, his divinity is destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter is already found in the pyramid of Unas (l. 379-399).
Prof. Erman (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Zeitschr.</cite></span>, XXXIII, p. 2) has made a special study
of it, and has pointed out that the title of this Chapter originates
from a misunderstanding of the word <img class="hiero" src="images/h021.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h213.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h107.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which should be a star
and not a gate or a door. Were it not for the vignette, which
represents the deceased, the woman Muthotepet coming out of a
door, we should translate: “Chapter of the coming forth of the
<i>Chu</i> as a great star in the sky”; in accordance with these words
found in the course of the chapter: “Shestet gave me birth to be
her star, Sothis,” etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two papyri only contain this Chapter, one in London and one
in Paris. The London text has a vignette with these words: “the
coming out of the door in the sky by....”</p>

Maspero translates: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton fils t’a fait
(le sacrifice)</span>. The word <img class="hiero" src="images/h387.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is employed here as in the rubric of
Chapter 141, “to say, to speak.” This speech is a ceremonial act, one
of the <img class="hiero" src="images/h1958.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h016.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h1698.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> done for the deceased.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note174.2'/><a href='#nref174.2'>2.</a>
We noticed before (Chapter 160, <a href='#note160.1'>note 2</a>) that <img class="hiero" src="images/h1959.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is a
variant for <img class="hiero" src="images/h1957.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> when applying to Tmu. Here it applies to Horus.
The unknown word <img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h068.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> being parallel, I give it conjecturally a
similar sense.</p>

<img class="hiero" src="images/h1961.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> “the great one, the great goddess,” and its variants

and seem to be a name of the sky.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note174.4'/><a href='#nref174.4'>4.</a>
<img class="hiero" src="images/h1786.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /><img class="hiero" src="images/h298.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> which is found in the papyrus, is clearly a mistake
for the name of the goddess <i>Shestet</i>, which we read in the text of
Unas.</p>

In the pictures in the royal tombs the sun-god stands in

West of Rā, meaning on his right side. Rā is spoken of here as
if he were a human being, turning towards the South as all Egyptians
did. His west is his right-hand side. Even now the Egyptian
fellaheen in their language do not often say right and left, they
generally make use of the points of the compass: west of thee, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Chapter of not dying a second death in the Netherworld.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>O Thoth(<a id='nref175.1'></a><a href='#note175.1'>1</a>)! What has become of the children of Nut? they
have stirred up hostilities, they have raised storms, they have committed
iniquit, they have raised rebellion, they have perpetrated
murder, they have done oppression, and thus have acted, the strong
against the weak, in all that they have done to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grant, O Thoth, what Tmu hath decreed. Thou seest not the
iniquities, thou art not pained at their attacks upon the years, and
their invasions upon the months, because they have done their
mischiefs in secret.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am thy pallet, O Thoth, and I bring to thee thine inkstand;
I am not one of those who do mischief in secret. Let not mischief
be done unto me.</p>

<p class='c000'>O Tmu! what is this place to which I have journeyed? for it is
without water and without air! It is all abyss, utter darkness, sheer
perplexity. One liveth here in peace of heart. There is no
pleasure of love here. Let there be granted to me glory instead of
water, air and pleasures of love; and peace of heart instead of
bread and beer.</p>

<p class='c000'>[Decree this, Tmu, that if I see thy face I shall not be pained
by thy sufferings(<a id='nref175.2'></a><a href='#note175.2'>2</a>).... Tmu decrees; behold the great gods
have given him this mission, he will reign on his throne and he will
inherit his throne in the Isle of fire: and for thee I decree that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>god may see him as his second self, and that my face may see thy
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>My lord Tmu, what is the duration of my life? Thou art for
eternities of eternities, the duration of endless years; and behold I
am going to deface all I have done: this earth will become water,
an inundation as it was in the beginning. I will remain with
Osiris, and I will make my form like another serpent, whom no man
will know, and no god will see.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is good what I have done to Osiris, who is exalted above all
the gods. I have given him the power in the region of the
Netherworld, and his son Horus will inherit his throne in the Isle of
flame. I will make his throne in the boat of millions of (years).</p>

<p class='c000'>Horus is well established on his seat in order that he may take
possession of his place of rest; also I send a soul to Sut in the
West, who is exalted above all gods; and I have caused his soul to
be guarded in the boat, so that he may feel reverential fear of the
divine body (Osiris).]</p>

<p class='c000'>O my father Osiris! I have done for thee what thy father Rā did
for thee. Let me have increase upon earth, let me keep my dwelling
place, let my heir be vigorous, let my sepulchre flourish and my
dependents upon earth. Let all my adversaries be crushed to
pieces with Selk’et (the scorpion goddess) over their ruin. I am
thy son, O my father Rā! thou hast been the cause of this Life,
Health and Strength. Horus is established upon his throne.

<p class='c000'>The translation and notes of this Chapter, except what is in
brackets, are Renouf’s work. They are taken from the introduction
he published to his edition of the papyrus of Ani (p. 16).</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignette represents the deceased and his wife worshipping
Thoth.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter is found in the papyrus of Ani, and at greater
length in a papyrus of the Museum of Leyden, from which it has
been copied by Naville into his edition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Leyden text is unfortunately very incomplete, both in the
upper and lower parts of the columns. The two texts differ very
materially in some of their readings, and will require considerable
study before a satisfactory translation can be given.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span><a id='note175.1'/><a href='#nref175.1'>1.</a>
The deceased is evidently supposed to be just arrived in a
place of utter darkness and desolation, and expresses his feelings
of distress to Thoth in the opening address.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note175.2'/><a href='#nref175.2'>2.</a>
[The text of Leyden is much more complete. Owing probably
to want of space, the scribe of Ani has shortened his text. There
the omissions are so considerable that it is impossible to find a sense.
I have often adopted the reading of the Leyden papyrus in the
translation of this part of the chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='note175.3'/><a href='#nref175.3'>3.</a>
The remaining columns in the Leyden manuscript, although
incomplete, enable us to see that the deceased is assimilated
throughout to Osiris, as born again in his son Horus. There is a
cry of adoration to him in Sutenhenen, and exultation in En-aaref,
the whole cycle of the gods is filled with satisfaction at seeing him
inherit his throne and rule over the earth. Sut is filled with terror
when he sees the change which has taken place; the different
generations of mankind, the past, the present, and the future, are in
obeisance. Mention is made of the “Hoeing” and of the blood
which flowed in Sutenhenen [an allusion to the myth of the destruction
of mankind] and of other particulars in connection with Osiris.
And the chapter is said to be recited over an image of Horus made
of lapis lazuli (or blue material) and placed at the throat of the
deceased. It is also to be recited in the Netherworld.</p>

    <div><i>Chapter of raising the body, of giving it eyes, of making it possess ears, of fixing its head, of putting it on its base.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>Thou hast received the eye of Horus;(<a id='nref178.1'></a><a href='#note178.1'>1</a>) thy table is a table of
offerings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hail, Hunnu, lift up thy heart to purify thy body; they have
eaten the eye of Horus, the olive of Heliopolis,(<a id='nref178.2'></a><a href='#note178.2'>2</a>) they destroy
(what is wrong) in the body of Osiris.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<a id='nref178.3'></a><a href='#note178.3'>3</a>)The mouth of <i>N.</i> had been thirsty; but he will never hunger
(any more); <i>N.</i> will never thirst; for Chas delivers him and does
away with hunger.</p>

<p class='c000'>O you who fill the vases, you chiefs who distribute bread and
cakes, and who have charge of the waterflood; there was ordered
for <i>N.</i> bread and beer, Rā himself ordered them; he ordered them
to those who fill the year with plenty; they seize them (the gifts)
and they give him his wheat, his barley, his loaves, for he is the
great bull.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Grant to <i>N.</i> the charge of the five loaves in the funerary chapel;
there are three in heaven for Rā, there are two on earth for the
cycle of the gods, and Nu sees them.</p>

<p class='c000'>O, Rā, be gracious to <i>N.</i> in this happy day when <i>N.</i> joined Shu
and Isis, and when he was united to (Nekhebit);(<a id='nref178.4'></a><a href='#note178.4'>4</a>) they give bread
and beer to <i>N.</i>, and they do all the things good and pure in this
happy day, the things of Tum, bringing him the things of the eye of
Horus ... whenever he arrives to see the god.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thou takest possession of water, and thou marchest towards the
altar of Sashert: four measures of water, as was commanded by
Osiris to <i>N.</i> Shu has handed over his wealth to <i>N.</i>; they are thy
bread and thy beer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Awake, lofty judge; awake, thou sleeper; awake from thy ...
thy offerings are brought before Thoth and Horus, who comes out
from the Nile, and Apuat who comes out of Asert.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is pure, the mouth of <i>N.</i>; the cycle of the gods offers incense
to the mouth of <i>N.</i> His mouth is pure verily, and his tongue in his
mouth, for <i>N.</i> hates filth, he is washed from impurity as Sut is washed
in the city of the Rehui when he goes with Thoth to heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>Feed <i>N.</i> with you; let him eat what you eat, drink as you drink,
sit as you sit, be mighty as you are mighty, navigate as you navigate.
The tent of <i>N.</i> is woven in the field of Aarru, his running water is in
the Garden of Hotepit. Offerings are made to him among the
gods; the drink of <i>N.</i> is the wine of Rā.</p>

<p class='c000'>He goes round the sky like Rā, he travels over the sky like
Thoth. <i>N.</i> execrates hunger, he does not eat (feel) it, he execrates
thirst. <i>N.</i> has received bread from the lord of eternity.</p>

<p class='c000'>He ordered that <i>N.</i> should be conceived in the night and born
in the morning, close to the follower of Rā, before the morning star.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>N.</i> was conceived of <i>N.</i> and born of <i>N.</i>, he brings you the loaves
which he found in the pupil of the eye of Horus, on the bough of
the <i>tennu</i> tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came, Khenta Amenta brought him the victuals and
the offerings of Horus in his abodes where he lives of them. <i>N.</i>
lives of them; as Horus drinks, <i>N.</i> drinks; his food is on the altar of
Sashert. <i>N.</i> is welcome to Anubis on his mountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hail, <i>N.</i>, thy figure is that which thou hadst on earth, thou art
living and renewed every day. Thy face is unveiled, and thou seest
the lord of the horizon; he gives bread to <i>N.</i> at his hour of the day
and at his appointed time in the night. Horus has avenged thee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>he has smashed the jawbones of thy enemies, he has smitten the
violent one at the door of his fortress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hail, <i>N.</i>, thine enemies are no more, in the great hall the scales
are right concerning thee, thou makest long strides like Osiris(<a id='nref178.5'></a><a href='#note178.5'>5</a>)
the lord of the arrivals in the Amenta. He arrives when he likes, he
sees the great god in his creations, life is given to his nostrils, he is
triumphant over his enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hail, <i>N.</i> Thou hatest falsehood, thou propitiatest the lord of (all)
things in the night of “stopping the tears,” thou receivest sweet life
from the mouth of the cycle of the gods, and Thoth is satisfied in
giving thee victory over thine enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nut spreads her wings over thee in her name of the veil of the
sky, she giveth thee to be in the following of the great god, thine
enemies are no more. She delivers thee of all evil things in her
name of Chnumeturit, for she is the great one among her children.</p>

<p class='c000'>O chief of the hours, in front of Rā, make way for <i>N.</i> that he
may arrive into the circle of Osiris, the living lord of the two earths,
who lives eternally.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>N.</i> is in the following of Nefertmu, he is the lotus at the nostrils

<p class='c000'>This Chapter, taken from London 9900, is found complete in the
pyramid of Unas (l. 166 ff.). Four other pyramids, those of Teta,
Pepi I, Merenrā and Pepi II contain the greatest part of it; as also
does a stele of the XIIth Dynasty found in Abydos, and belonging
to a man called Nehi. Hatshepsu had it copied on both sides of
the chamber of offering specially dedicated to her (<cite>Deir el Bahari</cite>,
Vol. IV, pl. CIX-XIII and p. 8). In the pyramids as well as at
the temple this text is connected with offerings. The representation
in the temple may be considered as the vignette to this chapter.

<p class='c000'>The papyri give us four versions of this Chapter. Two of them
are in London 9900 <i>Aa</i>, but as they are both copied from the
wrong side, they are of little use. Each of them had its own title;
one was, “the worshipping of Rā in the good Amenta, the praising
of the inhabitants of the Tuat,” and the other, “chapter of towing
(the gods)”; the two other copies are, one in a papyrus in Paris and
the other at Leyden.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Chapter does not properly belong to the Book of the Dead.
It is part of a book engraved at the entrance of nearly all the tombs
of the kings, the so-called “Litany of the Sun.” This chapter is
taken from the end of the book. The various paragraphs are not
always in the same order as in the monumental text. There are
abridgments and many omissions, which in the translation have been
filled up from the text in the tombs.</p>

to whom the <i>urer</i> diadem and the <i>hik</i> sceptre has been given in the
presence of the cycle of the gods. Tum has raised the fear of his might
in the hearts of mankind, of the gods, the Glorified and the dead;
the royal power has been given him in Heliopolis; he is the great
forms in Tattu, the lord of fear in his two abodes, the very brave one
in Restau, he whose memory is pleasant in the palace, the very
brilliant in Abydos. It has been given him to triumph before the
whole cycle of the gods; he is mighty more than the great powers;
the fear of him is over the whole earth.</p>

him in Cherāba, the future ones rejoice in him. He receives the
choicest meat offerings in the upper abodes; haunches are presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>to him in Memphis, the festival of the Eve’s provender is celebrated
to him in Sechem, he is the great, the mighty one.</p>

thee with life health and strength, and all the joy which they

desirest to receive, it is on thy hands in the Amenta.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thou navigatest through the sky every day, thou leadest him

Thoth may cling to thee and the health of Isis be within thy limbs.</p>

Osiris who come there in his form(<a id='nref182.2'></a><a href='#note182.2'>2</a>) ... as protector, saviour,
defender in the Netherworld.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>It is said by Thoth himself, so that the morning light may shine
on him (Osiris) every day.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>I am Thoth, the perfect scribe, whose hands are pure, who
opposes every evil deed, who writes justice and who execrates every
wrong, he who is the writing reed of the Inviolate god, the lord of
laws, whose words are written and whose words have dominion over
the two earths.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am the lord of justice, the witness of right before the gods; I
direct the words so as to make the wronged victorious. I have
dispelled darkness, and driven away the storm. I have given the
sweet breaths of the North to Osiris when he comes out of the womb
which bare him. I give Rā to be setting as Osiris and Osiris to be
setting as Rā. I give him to enter the mysterious cave in order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>revive the heart of him whose heart is motionless, the exalted soul
which is in the Amenta.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hail, acclamations to thee, god whose heart is motionless,
Unneferu, the son of Nut. I am Thoth, the favourite of Rā, the
very brave, who is beneficent to his father; the great magician in
the boat of millions (of years); the lord of laws, who pacifies the
two earths by the power of his wisdom ... who drives away enmity
and dispels quarrels, who does what is pleasing to Rā in his shrine.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am Thoth, who giveth Osiris victory over his enemies; I am
Thoth, who prepares to-morrow and who foresees what will come
afterwards; his action is not vain when he settles what is in the sky,
the earth and the Tuat, and when he gives life to the future ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>I give breath to the hidden ones by the virtue of my speech.
Osiris is triumphant against his enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have come to the lord of Ta-tsert, Osiris the bull of the Amenta,
who lasts forever. I give an eternal protection to thy limbs; I have
come bearing the amulet in my hand; my protection is active every
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The living charm is behind him, behind this god, whose <i>ka</i> is
glorious, the king of the Tuat, the prince of the Amenta, who takes
hold of the sky, triumphantly, on whom the <i>atef</i> crown is established,
who shines with the white diadem, who has seized the hook and the
flail; mighty is his soul, the great one of the <i>urer</i> crown; who has
united all the gods, the love of him penetrates their bodies, Unneferu
who lasts for ever and eternally.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hail to thee, Chenta Amenta, who giveth birth to all human
beings a second time, who is renewed in an instant, who is better than
those who were before. Thy son Horus establishes thee on the
pedestal of Tmu; thy face is perfect, Unneferu.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arise, bull of the Amenta, thou art established, well established
in the womb of Nut; she replenishes thee (with life and health)
when thou comest out of her. Thy heart is well established on its
stands and thy whole heart as at the beginning. Thy nose is vivified
with the breath of life; thou art living, renewed, made young like
Rā every day, thou art great and triumphant, Osiris, who has been
revived.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am Thoth, I have calmed Horus, I have pacified the Rehiu in
their moment of storm. I have come, I have washed away the Red
ones; I have calmed down the riotous, and I have struck him
with (?) all kinds of evil things.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>I am Thoth, I have celebrated the festival of Eve’s provender in
Sechem. I am Thoth, I come every day from Pu Tepu, I have
directed the offerings, I have given cakes to the glorious ones who
stretched forth their hands. I have avenged the arm of Osiris,
I have embalmed it. I have made sweet its fragrance like good
perfumes.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am Thoth, I come every day to Cherāba; I fastened the tackle;
I let the boat go: I brought it from East to West. I am higher on
my pedestal than any god, for my name is he who is high on his
pedestal. I opened the good roads in my name of Apuatu, I give
thee acclamations, and I throw myself down on the earth before
Osiris Unneferu the eternal, the everlasting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapters 182 and 183 are hymns to Osiris very like each other,
supposed to be pronounced by Thoth himself. Occasionally it is
difficult to distinguish whether the words are spoken by the god or
the deceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter 182 is taken from Papyrus 10010 in London.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Adoration to Osiris, giving him praise, bowing down before Unneferu,
falling on one’s face before the lord of Ta-tsert, and exalting him
who is on his sand.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>I have come to thee, son of Nut, Osiris, prince everlasting. I
am in the train of Thoth, I rejoice in all that he has done.</p>

<p class='c000'>He brings thee sweet breezes to thy nose, the breath of life to
thy beautiful face, the wind coming out of Tmu to thy nostrils, lord
of Ta-tsert.</p>

<p class='c000'>He grants that the morning light shine on thy body, he illuminateth
thy path with his rays, he removeth all that is wrong in thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>body by the virtue of his speech. He appeases the two gods, the
two brothers, he drives away anger and quarrel, and he made the
two Rehti, the two sisters, gracious unto thee, so that the two earths
may be at peace before thee; he removes the displeasure out of their
hearts, so that one embraces the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thy son Horus is triumphant before the whole cycle of gods;
he has received the royal power on the earth, and his dominion over
the whole earth; the throne of Seb has been imparted to him; the
high dignity of Tmu is kept in record as his possession, engraved on
a brick of iron, as was ordered by thy father Tatunen in his
sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c000'>(This god) giveth thee to join him on the firmament, when he
raiseth water on the mountains in order to make growth come forth
on the mountains, and all growth spring out of the earth; he
brings forth all products on water and on land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thou hast handed over to thy son Horus all the gods of Heaven
and the gods of earth, they are his servants at his gates, and all that
he has commanded is before them; they fulfil it at once; thy heart
is satisfied, thy heart, lord of the gods, is overjoyed because of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egypt and the desert are at peace; they are the vassals of thy
royal diadem; the temples and the cities are well ordered in their
places; the cities and the provinces are his possession according to
their names, they bring to thee tributes of offerings, and they make
libations to thy name for ever. Thou art called upon, and thy name
is praised, thy <i>ka</i> is gratified by funereal meals.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Glorified who are in thy following sprinkle water on thy food
by the side of the dead souls in this land. All thy thoughts are
excellent like those of him who was at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Be crowned, son of Nut, as the Inviolate god is crowned; thou
art living, thou art revived, thou art renewed, thou art perfect. Thy
father Rā giveth health to all thy limbs, thy divine circle giveth thee
praise. Isis is with thee, she will never leave thee before all thy
enemies are struck down.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the lands praise thy beauties like Rā when he rises every
morning; thou art crowned like him who is high on his pedestal, thy
beauties are exalted, thy strides are lengthened; thou hast received
the royal power of Seb, thy father who creates thy beauties; thy
mother gave existence to thy limbs, Nut who bare the gods bare
thee to be the chief of the five gods. The white crown of the South
is placed on thy head; thou seizest the hook and the flail. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>thou wast still in the womb, before thou didst appear on earth, thou
wast crowned to be lord of the two earths, the <i>atef</i> crown of Rā was
on thy head.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gods come to thee, bowing down, the fear of thee possesses
them; they see thee with the might of Rā, and the valour of thy
majesty fills their hearts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Life is with thee, abundance is attached to thee. I offer Maat
before thee; grant that I may be in the train of thy majesty like one
who is on the earth. May thy name be called upon, may it
be found among the just ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have come to the city of this god, to the city of god, to the
region of old time; my soul, my <i>ka</i>, my Chu are in this land. The
god of it is the lord of justice, the lord of abundance, the great and
the venerable one, who is towed through the whole earth; he
journeys to the South in his boat, and to the North driven by the
winds, and his oars, to be entertained with gifts according to the
command of the god, the lord of peace therein, who left me free of
care. The god therein rejoices in him who practices justice; he
grants an old age to him who has done so; he is beloved, and the
end of it is a good burial and a sepulture in Ta-tsert.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have come to thee; my hands bring Maāt, my heart does not
contain any falsehood, I offer thee Maāt before thy face, I know
her; I swear by her; I have done no evil thing on earth; I have
never wronged a man of his property. I am Thoth, the perfect and
pure writer; my hands are pure. I have put away all evil things; I
write justice and I hate evil; for I am the writing-reed of the
Inviolate god, who utters his words, and whose words are written in
the two earths.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am Thoth, the lord of justice, who giveth victory to him who is
injured and who taketh the defense of the oppressed, of him who is
wronged in his property. I have dispelled darkness; I have driven
away the storm; I have given air to Unneferu, and the sweet breezes
of the North when he comes out of the womb of his mother. I have
given him to enter into the mysterious cave where is revived the
heart of the god whose heart is motionless, Unneferu, the son of
Nut, the victorious.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are sixty two plates, some spanning facing pages. They were not
bound in strict sequential order, and were not considered
in the pagination. All full and double page plates have been moved to
the end of the text and are represented in the text as placeholders
that serve as links. These are positioned to avoid paragraph breaks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Please note that Chapter CX, appearing at pp 193-195 in the orginal, is
out of sequence with Chapters CXI-CXVI.</p>

<p class='c000'>At <a id='c_63.14'></a><a href='#corr63.14'>63.14</a>, the Western Syriac word <img class="hiero" src="images/h000.jpg" height="30" alt="⁂" /> is rendered as ܐܷܠܴ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The text of each chapter is glossed with chapter endnotes, each of which
is linked for ease of navigation. The scheme was not cleanly followed.
Fortunately, each note repeats a phrase in the text, so the references
can usually be traced. Where no obvious correction is possible, the text
remains unlinked.</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>The reference to Chapter 41, note 8 is wrong, and there is no other obvious note.

    </li>
    <li>The identifier for Note 5 on p. 81 was missing, and has been restored.

    </li>
    <li>The reference to “Lord of the One Face” (Note 5 on p. 133) has been restored to the 
    appropriate place.

    </li>
    <li>In the summary note to Chapter 22 on p. 61, there is an apparent reference ‘(2)’, for 
    which there is no obvious referent. It is  retained, but mentioned below.

    </li>
    <li>In the Notes for Chapter 46 on p. 102, there is a reference to note 6 of Chapter 124, 
    which does not exist.

    </li>
    <li>The numbering of notes in Chapter 64 was confused.  The reference to note 15 was 
    missing, and has been added. There were two note 21’s and a repeated reference to note 
    23. These have been resequenced.

    </li>
    <li>There is a reference to note 6 in Chapter 72 for which there is no corresponding note.

    </li>
    <li>The reference to note 5 in Chapter 112 was missing and, based on the subject of the 
    note, has been placed after the final word on p. 184.

    </li>
    <li>At 218.21, a spurious reference to a note 49 has been added, causing the numbering of 
    the final 6 references to be off by one. The reference is removed, and the numbering 
    resequenced.

    </li>
    <li>The reference to note 4 in Chapter 144 was missing and has been placed after the 
    phrase “receives the saying” at line 288.9.

    </li>
    <li>The reference to note 2 in Chapter 176 was missing and has been placed after the 
    phrase “flame born” at line 340.8.

    </li>
    <li>Note 6 of Chapter 176 has no reference in the text.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c000'>The singular and plural names ‘Uræus’ and ‘Uræi’ usually appear with
the ‘æ’ ligature, but twice each as ‘Uraeus’ or ‘Uraei’. The
ligature version has been adopted, for the sake of text searches, as
noted below.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proper name ‘Maāt’ which appears more than fifty times, is spelled
a handful of times without the macron on the second ‘a’ later in the
text (pp. 336, 344, 353, 374x4). These have been amended</p>

<p class='c000'>Those errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
